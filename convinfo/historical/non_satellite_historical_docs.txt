I.  AIRCRAFT (INCLUDING RECONNAISSANCE) 

     07/11/1990/1200UTC:
          The new PREPACFT QC code (see NMC Office Note 358) is now operational in the RGL and GBL.  It QC's AIREP and PIREP wind reports and superobs co-located reports passing checks.  It also track-checks AMDAR reports.    
     12/12/1990/1200UTC:
           MDCRS-ACARS winds now used in GBL and RGL analyses.
     12/14/1990/1200UTC:
          MDCRS-ACARS winds no longer used in GBL and RGL analyses due to a duplicate data problem.
     01/09/1991/1200UTC:
          MDCRS-ACARS winds again used in RGL analysis.
     03/07/1991/1200UTC:
          MDCRS-ACARS winds again used in GBL analysis.
     06/25/1991/1200UTC:
          GBL-SSI implementation resulted in several changes in data usage in GBL analysis: All aircraft type (including MDCRS-ACARS) temperatures now used.  AIREP and PIREP reports are no longer superobed by the PREPACFT QC program (they are still superobed in RGL). MDCRS do not pass through this program.
     09/02/1992/1200UTC:
          AIREP and PIREP wind (RGL and GBL) and temperature (GBL) reports over CONUS are no longer used in the RGL and GBL analyses if there are at least 101 MDCRS-ACARS reports here.
     02/20/1996/1200UTC:
          MDCRS-ACARS wind reports below 2286 meters but above 0 meters are now used in the RGL analysis.
     10/22/1997/1200UTC:
          MDCRS-ACARS wind reports are now used down to -200 meters (was 0 meters) and AMDAR wind reports are now used down to 0 meters (was 2286 meters) in the RGL analysis.
     11/05/1997/1200UTC:
          MDCRS-ACARS and AMDAR wind and temperature reports are now processed down to -200 meters (was 2286 meters) in the GBL analysis.  Also, AIREP and PIREP reports over the CONUS are now used in the GBL analysis regardless of the number of MDCRS-ACARS here (still not used over CONUS in RGL analysis if greater than 101 MDCRS-ACARS here).
     02/09/1998/1200UTC:
          RGL-3DVAR implementation resulted in several changes in data usage in RGL analysis:  All aircraft type (MDCRS-ACARS, AIREP/PIREP, AMDAR and reconnaissance) temperature reports are now used.  AIREP and PIREP reports are no longer superobed by the PREPACFT QC program.
     01/15/2002/1200UTC:
          MDCRS-ACARS reports above 16,500 meters are no longer used in the GBL or RGL analyses.
     05/07/2002/1500UTC:
          MDCRS-ACARS reports received from AFWA (who receives them from ARINC) are now decoded into /dcom BUFR tank b004/xx007. These will eventually be used as a backup when the normal MDCRS-ACARS reports received directly from ARINC (in /dcom BUFR tank b004/xx004) are very low or not available.  European AMDAR (E-AMDAR) temperature and wind data ingested into /dcom BUFR tank b004/xx006.
     05/28/2002/1200UTC:
          MDCRS-ACARS reports are now quality controlled by the new program PREPOBS_ACARSQC which runs in all networks where ACARS data are assimilated.
     09/17/2002/2100UTC:
     The RUC dump jobs will now sleep for 5 minutes and dump again in the event that ZERO MDCRS-ACARS reports are found in the initial dump.  This re-dump will be attempted only once after which the RUC will run without any MDCRS-ACARS data available to the assimilation.
     03/02/2004/1200UTC;
          All networks which assimilate MDCRS-ACARS data will now compare the number of reports dumped from /dcom BUFR tank b004/xx004 (MDCRS-ACARS received directly from ARINC) vs. the number of reports dumped from /dcom BUFR tank b004/xx007 (MDCRS-ACARS received from AFWA).  If the latter is greater than the former, then the latter will be assimilated.  This will rarely happen but it does provide a backup source of MDCRS-ACARS data for the assimilation systems.
     04/13/2004/1200UTC:
          European AMDAR (E-AMDAR) temperature and wind data included in "aircft" dumps in GFS and GDAS networks.
     01/25/2005:
          European AMDAR (E-AMDAR) temperature and wind data processed in RGL and GBL analyses.
     02/14/2006/1200UTC:
          TAMDAR aircraft data (type Mesaba) received from GSD-MADIS are now ingested into /dcom tank b004/xx008. Canadian AMDAR aircraft data received from GTS are now ingested into /dcom tank b004/xx009. These are not yet dumped in any network.
     05/16/2006/1200UTC:
          TAMDAR (type Mesaba) (from GSD-MADIS) and Canadian AMDAR aircraft data are now included in the "aircft" dump file in the GFS, GDAS, CDAS, NAM and NDAS networks.  These data are not yet included in any network PREPBUFR file.  The Canadian AMDAR data are restricted.  The GSD-MADIS TAMDAR data are not restricted st this time.
     10/02/2007/1800UTC:
          ARINC corrected an error in the way they were encoding mixing ratio in the BUFR files we process (problem was introduced 6 September 2006).  Their values for mixing ratio were a factor of 10 too high.  Most mixing ratio values were too large to store in BUFR and the ones that were stored were 10 times too large.
     12/04/2007/1200UTC:
          All aircraft type temperature reports with missing wind data are now assimilated in the RGL and GBL analyses.  TAMDAR (type Mesaba) (from GSD-MADIS) and Canadian AMDAR aircraft data are now processed into the PREPBUFR file in the GFS, GDAS, NAM and NDAS networks as type 134/234.  These are now monitored by the GBL- and NAM-GSI.
     03/18/2008/120UTC:
          TAMDAR aircraft data (type Mesaba) received from AirDAT on GTS are now ingested into /dcom tank b004/xx010. These are not yet dumped in any network.  These data are restricted.
     08/29/2008/2200UTC:
          GSD-MADIS added type Chautauqua to their TAMDAR feed which is ingested into /dcom tank b004/xx008 (along with existing type Mesaba), included in the "aircft" dump file in the GFS, GDAS, CDAS, NAM and NDAS networks, processed into the PREPBUFR file in the GFS, GDAS, NAM and NDAS networks as type 134/234, and monitored by the GBL- and NAM-GSI.  Chautauqua has not yet been added to the AirDAT TAMDAR data (which currently consists of just the single type Mesaba) which is ingested into /dcom tank b004/xx010.
     09/10/2008/1800UTC:
          GSD-MADIS added type PenAir to their TAMDAR feed which is ingested into /dcom tank b004/xx008 (along with existing types Mesaba and Chautauqua), included in the "aircft" dump file in the GFS, GDAS, CDAS, NAM and NDAS networks, processed into the PREPBUFR file in the GFS, GDAS, NAM and NDAS networks as type 134/234, and monitored by the GBL- and NAM-GSI.  Neither PenAir nor Chautauqua has yet been added to the AirDAT TAMDAR data (which currently consists of just the single type Mesaba) which is ingested into /dcom tank b004/xx010.
     09/15/2008/1500UTC:
          AIREP, PIREP, AMDAR (including E-AMDAR and Canadian AMDAR) and TAMDAR (types Mesaba, PenAir and Chautauqua, from GSD-MADIS) aircraft data are now included in the new "aircft" dump file and the PREPBUFR file in the RUC network (report types 130/230, 131/231, 134/234, 135,235).  None of these types are assimilated by the RUC analysis.  They will be used by the future (2009) RapidRefresh system.
     09/16/2008/1500UTC:
          GSD-MADIS TAMDAR aircraft data have been split into three separate /dcom tanks based on their type.  Mesaba is written into existing tank b004/xx008, PenAir is written into new tank b004/xx012, and Chautauqua is written into new tank b004/xx013.  All tanks are also now restricted as requested by AirDAT and NWS.  All types continue to be included in the "aircft" dump file in the GFS, GDAS, CDAS, NAM, NDAS and RUC networks, processed into the PREPBUFR file in the GFS, GDAS, NAM, NDAS and RUC networks as type 134/234, and monitored by the GBL- and NAM-GSI.
     12/09/2008/1600UTC:
          AirDAT added type Chautauqua to their TAMDAR feed which is ingested into /dcom tank b004/xx010 (along with existing type Mesaba).  The GSD-MADIS TAMDAR data (which contains all three types) is still dumped and tested in the NAM and RUC.
     12/16/2008/1200UTC:
          TAMDAR aircraft (all three types) temperature, moisture and wind (PREPBUFR report types 134/234) (from the GSD-MADIS feed) are now used by the NAM-GSI.  Canadian AMDAR aircraft temperature and wind (PREPBUFR report types 135/235) are now used by the NAM-GSI.
     12/16/2008/1500UTC:
          TAMDAR aircraft (all three types) temperature and moisture (PREPBUFR report type 134) (from the GSD-MADIS feed) are now used by the RUC analysis (even though moisture has a flagged QM of 15, it is not honored).  TAMDAR winds (PREPBUFR report type 234) (from the GSD-MADIS feed) are still not used by the RUC analysis because winds from descending flights are of low quality (and we don't yet have a phase-of-flight indicator in the TAMDAR wind reports).
     03/12/2009:
          TAMDAR aircraft data from the GSD-MADIS feed has been temporarily suspended because AirDAT is moving the data to a new server.  These data will not be available for assimilation in the NAM-GSI nor in the RUC analysis. The AirDAT feed for TAMDAR data remains up and we continue to tank these data, however NCEP is not in a position (yet) to make a seamless switch to the AirDAT feed (plus these data have not been tested).  [Note: The GSD-MADIS TAMDAR feed returned on 03/27/2009 (see below).]
     03/23/2009/1400UTC:
          AirDAT added type PenAir to their TAMDAR feed which is ingested into /dcom tank b004/xx010 (along with existing types Mesaba and Chautauqua).  The GSD-MADIS TAMDAR data (which contains all three types) is still dumped and assimilated in the NAM and RUC.
     03/27/2009:
          TAMDAR aircraft data from the GSD-MADIS feed has now been restored and is again being assimilated in the NAM-GSI and in the RUC analysis.  This feed had been down since 03/12/2009 while AirDAT moved the data to a new server.
     04/06/2009/0400UTC;
          All TAMDAR data from AirDAT-feed has been turned off until the NWS/AirDAT contract is  renegotiated.  This could be 2-3 weeks.  These data are not assimilated.
     04/07/2009/2025UTC;
          All TAMDAR data from MADIS-feed has been turned off until the NWS/AirDAT contract is renegotiated.  This could be 2-3 weeks.  This data had been assimilated in the NAM and RUC.
     06/19/2009:
          TAMDAR contract with NWS in the process of being re-negotiated.  An increased amount of data from all providers (vs. before the April 2009 shut down) now available in both the AirDAT feed (~6/19/2009, we do not yet use these data) and in the GSD-MADIS feed (7/1/2009).  We are dumping the latter data and they are being assimilated again in the NAM-GSI and RUC analysis. Note: This contract was re-negotiated ~8/7/2009 and will not expire until at least 27 October 2009.
     08/20/2009/1725UTC:
          NCEP stopped receiving TAMDAR data from the MADIS-feed (all 3 types) (this is assimilated in the NAM and RUC).  GSD changed their definition of TAMDAR data in the netCDF files they provide to NCEP - it was not advertised to NCEP/NCO.  (Data counts actually started going down in the dumps ~08/12/2009/1800UTC).  This was corrected at 08/26/2008/1700 UTC via an emergency implementation at NCEP to recognize the new TAMDAR definition. TAMDAR data began flowing again (in pre-8/12/09 numbers).  It was later discovered that since this time, no TAMDAR moisture (RH) was being received. This turned out to be another issue with the netCDF source files and the MADIS library.  NCEP/NCO implemented a patch to the library on 10/14/2009/1500UTC which turned the moisture data back on.
     10/30/2009:
          MDCRS-ACARS reports received from AFWA (who receives them from ARINC) are no longer available due to expiration of contract between AFWA and ARINC.  There is uncertainty whether these may someday again be available.  [These were used only on those rare occasions when the normal MDCRS-ACARS reports received directly from ARINC were very low or not available (maybe once or twice per year).]
     10/30/2009:
          We are now receiving a greatly reduced amount of TAMDAR data from all sources (thinned to about 90% less than before) (MADIS and AirDAT).  This is due to the renegotiation of the contract between AirDAT and the NWS.  The NWS would have to pay for the additional data and this is not possible at this time.
     03/02/2010/1500UTC:
          Canadian AMDAR temperature and wind data are now assimilated by the RUC analysis.
     04/06/2010/1400UTC:
          French AMDAR aircraft data received from GTS (currently consisting of test flight-level reports for the upcoming Concordiasi project) now ingested into /dcom tank b004/xx014. These are not yet dumped in any network.
     01/10/2011:
          French AMDAR aircraft data are no longer coming in (they had been ingested into /dcom tank b004/xx014). These were not yet dumped in any network.
     10/18/2011/1200UTC:
          MDCRS-ACARS moisture data are now assimilated by the NAM/NDAS GSI.  They had been monitored.
     08/26/2011/0000UTC through 08/29/2011/2300UTC:
          AirDAT provided full TAMDAR feed in support of NWP for Hurricane Irene.  About 50 times more data than normal was available to the NCEP analyses which use these data.
     11/19/2011/0400UTC:
          The NWS contract with AirDAT for TAMDAR data ended and was not renewed due to cost increases.  As a result these data are no longer available to NCEP.
     05/01/2012/1200UTC:
          The RAP (which replaces the RUC today) assimlates MDCRS-ACARS moisture data.
     07/17/2012/1000UTC:
          Enhanced NRL aircraft QC module replaces previous "Julian" aircraft QC modules (PREPACQC and ACARSQC).  The NRL QC code is also named PREPACQC.
     08/19/2014/1200UTC:
          Generalized AMDAR temperature and wind data from various new sources are now ingested into /dcom tank b004/xx103.  These are not yet dumped in any network.  (These will contain reports migrated from the WMO TAC AMDAR format in b004/xx003.)
     03/25/2015/1100UTC:
          High-Density OBservations (HDOB) from reconnaissance aircraft are now ingested into /dcom tank b004/xx015.  These will be used by the HRRR.
     03/31/2015/1700UTC:
          Air Wisconsin flights are now ingested into the MDCRS /dcom tank b004/xx004 and are included in the "aircar" dumps in all networks. These data are currently flagged with QM 14 (purge) in the dump sdmedit processing so they are only monitored by the GSI.
     04/21/2015/1200UTC:
          Aeroméxico and ADS-C flights are now ingested into the MDCRS /dcom tank b004/xx004 and are included in the "aircar" dumps in all networks. These data are currently flagged with QM 14 (purge) in the dump sdmedit processing so they are only monitored by the GSI.
     03/10/2016/1230UTC:
          Air Wisconsin temperature reports as well as Aeroméxico and ADS-C temperature and wind reports from most airframes (in /dcom tank b004/xx004 and "aircar" dumps) are now assimilated by the GSI in all networks. [The QM purge flag of 14 was removed from these types in the dump sdmedit processing.  The Air Wisconsin wind reports continue to be flagged with QM 14 in the dump sdmedit file, thus these continue to be monitored by the GSI (their quality is problematic).]
     05/11/2016/1200UTC:
          MDCRS-ACARS moisture data are now assimilated by the GFS/GDAS GSI.  They had been monitored.
     07/2016:
          The Air Wisconsin aircraft data stream was discontinued by Rockwell Collins (ARINC), in light of the pervasive nature of wind data anomalies that was determined as being too burdensome to properly rectify.
     11/17/2016/1315UTC:
          TAMDAR aircraft data received from Panasonic (AirDAT) on GTS (in BUFR) are now ingested into /dcom database tank b004/xx010. These are not yet dumped in any network.  These data are restricted.
     11/17/2016/1315UTC:
          The decoders for European AMDAR aircraft (E-AMDAR) data (originally in BUFR) (/dcom database tank b004/xx006), Automated AMDAR aircraft data (originally in BUFR) (/dcom database tank b004/xx103) and Automated MDCRS ACARS aircraft data (originally in BUFR) (/dcom database tank b004/xx004) have been modified to accomodate standard BUFR version 7 sequence which will be implemented by Rockwell Collins (ARINC) on GTS in the near future.  The decoders can handle the current legacy BUFR sequence.
     03/06/2017/1500UTC:
          Rockwell Collins (ARINC) implemented, on GTS, standard BUFR version 7 sequence for European AMDAR aircraft (E-AMDAR) data (originally in BUFR) (ingested into /dcom database tank b004/xx006), Automated AMDAR aircraft data (originally in BUFR) (ingested into /dcom database tank b004/xx103) and Automated MDCRS ACARS aircraft data (originally in BUFR) (ingested /dcom database tank b004/xx004).
     05/09/2017/1145UTC:
          TAMDAR aircraft data received from Panasonic (AirDAT) (/dcom database tank b004/xx010), Automated AMDAR aircraft data (originally in BUFR) (/dcom database tank b004/xx103) and Automated AMDAR aircraft data from Korea (/dcom database tank b004/xx011) are now included in the "aircft" dumps in the NAM, RAP and CDAS networks.  The TAMDAR data are not assimialted in any network.  The new AMDAR data are assimilated in all of these networks. None of these types are yet in the GFS/GDAS "aircft" dumps.
     08/03/2017/1800UTC:
          TAMDAR aircraft data received from Panasonic (AirDAT) and dumped in the "aircft" file are now assimilated in the RAP network.  They are not yet assimilated in any other network.
     12/21/2017/1200UTC:
          TAMDAR aircraft data received from Panasonic (AirDAT) (/dcom database tank b004/xx010), Automated AMDAR aircraft data (originally in BUFR) (/dcom database tank b004/xx103) and Automated AMDAR aircraft data from Korea (/dcom database tank b004/xx011) are now included in the "aircft" dumps in the GFS and GDAS networks.  The new AMDAR data are assimilated in the GFS and GDAS networks.  The TAMDAR data are monitored in the GFS and GDAS networks.  






II. WIND PROFILER, RASS and VAD   
     08/06/1991/1200UTC:
          NOAA Profiler Network (NPN) winds now used in RGL analysis.  (Also in RUC??)
     11/05/1997/1200UTC:
          VAD winds generated from Radar Coded Message are now used in the GBL analysis (not yet used in the RGL analysis). NOAA Profiler Network (NPN) winds are now used in the GBL analysis.  NPN wind profiler reports are QC'd until the NWS/AirDAT contract is  renegotiated.  This could be 2-3 weeks. by the new program PROFCQC, in the GBL only. 
     02/09/1998/1200UTC:
          RGL-3DVAR implementation resulted VAD winds generated from Radar Coded Message now being used in the RGL analysis.
     01/08/1999/1900UTC:
          VAD winds generated from Radar Coded Message are no longer being used in the RGL and GBL analyses due to quality issues.
     11/10/1999/1000UTC:
          NPN wind profiler reports are now QC'd by the program PROFCQC in the RGL and RUC networks (as they had been in the GBL networks).
     03/29/2000/1200UTC:
          VAD wind reports generated from Radar Coded Message are now QC'd by the new program CQCVAD.  All reports with a low RMSVE are now again used in the RGL and GBL analyses.
     01/09/2001/1200UTC:
          Tropical wind profilers that arrive disguised as PIBAL reports are now correctly processed as profilers and are used in the RGL (unlikely any present in domain) and GBL analyses.
     09/10/2002/1500UTC:
          JMA wind profiler data are now encoded into BUFR tanks b002/xx013 in /dcom.
      07/2003:
          NPN wind profiler surface data now decoded into /dcom tank b000/xx008.
     04/13/2004/1200UTC:
          JMA wind profiler and CAP wind profiler data are added to "proflr" dump - they are not yet written into PREPBUFR or assimilated in any network.
     01/25/2005/1200UTC:
          Program PROFCQC, which QC's wind profiler data, has been upgraded.  JMA wind profiler data now encoded in the GBL PREPBUFR files (report type 228) but they are not yet assimilated in any network.  CAP wind profiler data now encoded in the RUC and RGL PREPBUFR files (report type 227) but they are not yet assimilated in any network.
     04/28/2006:
          Cooperative Agency Profiler (CAP) data are no longer available via GTS/BUFR due to the NWS no longer supporting it.  There may be a way to get these data from FSL (GSD) MADIS in netCDF format. 
     11/30/2007:
          NPN wind profiler surface data no longer received.  These had been decoded into /dcom tank b000/xx008.
     09/15/2008/1500UTC:
          Wind profilers coming in in PILOT (PIBAL) bulletins are now included in the "proflr" dump file and the PREPBUFR file in the RUC network (report type 229).  These data are not assimilated by the RUC analysis.  They will be used by the future (2009) RapidRefresh system.
     10/01/2008:
          NOAA Profiler Network (NPN) wind profiler data (tank b002/xx007 and dump "proflr", used in the GFS, NAM and RUC analyses), spectral moment data (tank b002/xx010, not dumped or used by any analyses) and Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS) temperature profile data (tank b002/xx012 and dump "rassda", used in the RUC analysis, monitored in the GFS and NAM analyses) obtained from the GTS have been temporarily suspended for up to 90 days as a result of the need to upgrade these systems to prevent recently identified IT security threats. The wind profiler network operates on obsolete equipment that cannot support necessary IT security methods, and interconnection to major NWS systems extends the vulnerability to the entire NWS IT infrastructure.  The NPN profiler data (and possible the other types) will be available in the same BUFR format from an alternate GSD/MADIS feed within the next few (3-5) weeks.
     10/27/2008:
          NOAA Profiler Network (NPN) wind profiler data (tank b002/xx007 and dump "proflr", used in the GFS, NAM and RUC analyses), spectral moment data (tank b002/xx010, not dumped or used by any analyses) and Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS) temperature profile data (tank b002/xx012 and dump "rassda", used in the RUC analysis, monitored in the GFS and NAM analyses) are now again available, this time from the alternate GSD/MADIS feed.  This is temporary until the primary NWS feed is restored in approximately two months.  (See 10/01/2008 entry for more information.)
     11/25/2008/1500UTC:
          Multi-Agency Profiler (MAP) wind and RASS data [previously called Cooperative Agency Profiler (CAP)] are once again being decoded into tanks b002/xx011 [MAP profiler winds, including acoustic sounders (SODARs)] and b002/xx012 (MAP RASS, along with NPN RASS), via feed from GSD MADIS (decoded into BUFR from netCDF format).  The MAP winds are being written into the "proflr" dumps in the NAM/NDAS, GFS/GDAS and RUC networks.  They are included in the PREPBUFR file with report type 227 in the NAM/NDAS and RUC networks.  These are not monitored or assimilated in any network. The MAP RASS are being written into the "rassda" dumps and are included in the PREPBUFR file with report type 126 in the NAM/NDAS, GFS/GDAS and RUC networks.  These are assimilated in the RUC network and are monitored in the NAM/NDAS and GFS/GDAS networks.
     04/06/2010/1200UTC:
          VAD winds generated from Level 2 decoder are now encoded into BUFR tanks b004/xx017 in /dcom.  These data are not yet dumped in any NCEP network.  Planetary boundary layer heights generated from Level 2 decoder are now encoded into BUFR tanks b007/xx021 in /dcom.  These data are not yet dumped in any NCEP network.
     09/13/2011/1400UTC:
          The Multi-Agency Profiler (MAP) wind and RASS decoder was modified to fix a bug in the assignment of height levels that was introduced back when these data were re-introduced into the NCEP data processing (via GSD MADIS feed) on 11/25/2008. The reported heights were assumed to be height above ground and the station elevation was added to them to obtain height above sea-level. In reality, the reported heights were already height above sea-level, so the station elevation was being added to the heights above ground twice.
     10/18/2011/1200UTC:
          Multi-agency Profiler (MAP) wind data at and below 400 mb are now assimilated by the NAM/NDAS GSI.  Above 400 mb, these data are monitored by the NAM/NDAS GSI.  They had not even been monitored at any level before, except in the NAM/NDAS parallel GSI.  NOAA Profiler Network (NPN) and Multi-agency Profiler (MAP) RASS (virtual temperature) data are now assimilated by the NAM/NDAS GSI.  They had been monitored.
     05/01/2012/1200UTC:
          The RAP (which replaces the RUC today) assimlates Multi-agency Profiler (MAP) wind data at all levels (it also assililates NOAA Profiler Network (NPN) wind profiler data just as the RUC did).
     03/07/2013/0600UTC:
          An upstream BUFR change in the Japanese and Hong Kong winds on GTS caused NCEP's decoding of these data (into /dcom database tanks b002/xx013 and b002./xx014, resp.) to cease. The former was in the ops "proflr" dump and was being slated for testing in the Global GSI (it was kept out of ops PREPBUFR files).  The NCEP decoder was modified to again process these on 05/22/2014 however the data were routed to /dcomdev for testing.
     04/08/2014/1200UTC:
          VAD winds generated from Level 2 decoder are now dumped in the NAM/NDAS network (included with existing Radar Coded Message VAD winds in "vadwnd" dump).  These are excluded from the NAM/NDAS PREPBUFR files as the NAM/NDAS GSI is not ready to handle these.
     06/24/2014/1200UTC:
          MAP wind profilers with more than 102 levels will now get all levels encoded into the PREPBUFR file in the NAM, NDAS and RAP networks.
     08/12/2014/1200UTC:
          VAD winds generated from Level 2 decoder are now included in the NAM/NDAS PREPBUFR files (under report type 224, subtype 2; along with existing Radar Coded Message VAD winds under report type 224, subtype 1).  These are now assimilated by the NAM/NDAS GSI.
     08/30/2014:
          Thirty U.S. NOAA Profiler Network (NPN) sites (including RASS NPN) over the continental U.S. are terminated due to funding cuts.  The NPN network will consist of only 3 Alaskan sites after today.
     08/10/2015/1200UTC:
          VAD winds generated from Level 2 decoder are now dumped in the RAP network (included with existing Radar Coded Message VAD winds in "vadwnd" dump).  These are excluded from the RAP PREPBUFR files as the RAP GSI is not ready to handle these.
     08/23/2016/1200UTC:
          VAD winds generated from Level 2 decoder are now included in the RAP PREPBUFR files (under report type 224, subtype 2; along with existing Radar Coded Message VAD winds under report type 224, subtype 1).  These are now assimilated by the RAP GSI.
     09/13/2017/1430UTC:
          The remaining Alaskan NOAA Profiler Network (NPN) sites (including RASS NPN) have been turned off.  This marks the end of the NPN.  /dcom tanks b002/xx007 (NPN wind profiler) and b002/xx010 (NPN wind profiler spectral moments) are no longer created and the NPN wind profiler data are no longer part of the "proflr" dumps in the various networks.  Tank b002/xx012 now contains only Multi-Agency RASS reports and "rassda" dumps in the various networks no longer contain any NPN RASS reports.




III. RADIOSONDE, PIBAL, DROPWINSONDE (does NOT include RADCOR information at this time)
     01/07/1988:
          Indian radiosonde (block 42 and 43) mass data are no longer used in the GBL analysis.
     06/25/1991/1200UTC:
          GBL-SSI implementation resulted in several changes in data usage in GBL analysis: Significant and mandatory level data now used. No interpolation of data to missing levels (RGL analysis still uses special 25 or 50 mb levels with interpolation to missing levels). Uppermost mandatory pressure level for processing all variables except moisture changed from 50 to 10 mb.  Uppermost mandatory level below which significant level variables (except moisture) are processed is 50 mb.  Uppermost mandatory pressure level for processing moisture changed from 300 to 250 mb.
     02/10/1992/1800UTC:
          CLASS wind data (received from STORM-FEST field experiment) is now used in the RGL analysis.  These data were not present after 1997 and were also set to no longer be processed (they they ever became present again) in the RGL analysis on 02/09/1998/1200UTC.
     06/10/1992/1200UTC:
          The Complex Quality Control (CQC) system was implemented (for radiosonde data).  It replaced the "Hydrocheck" program.
     08/11/1993/1200UTC:
          The uppermost mandatory pressure level for processing mandatory and significant level data (including moisture) is changed from 10 mb (mandatory) and 50 mb (significant) and 250 mb (moisture) to 1 mb.
     08/28/1995/1200UTC:
          Surface mass dropwinsonde data are no longer used in the GBL analysis (due to quality issues).
     10/25/1995/1200UTC:
          Indian radiosonde (block 42 and 43) are now used in the GBL analysis.
     05/20/1997/1200UTC:
          The radiosonde baseline check in PREPRO has been turned off.  The CQC program already performs a much more sophisticated baseline check.
     06/11/1997/1200UTC:
          New NOAA Gulf Stream-IV dropwinsonde data is about to become operational.  Its specific humidity will not be used in the RGL or GBL analyses due to quality issues. (Later, on 01/14/1998/1200UTC, the RGL and GBL analyses began using Gulf Stream dropwinsonde moisture, then even later, on 12/15/1998/1200UTC, the RGL and GBL analysis again stopped using Gulf Stream dropwinsonde moisture.)
     02/09/1998/1200UTC:
          RGL-3DVAR implementation resulted in several changes in data usage in RGL analysis: Data are no longer interpolated to 25 or 50 mb levels (reported mandatory and significant levels are used directly).  Moisture is no longer interpolated to levels where it is missing. The uppermost mandatory pressure level for processing mandatory and significant level data (including moisture) is changed from 10 mb (mandatory) and 50 mb (significant) and 250 mb (moisture) to 1 mb. 
     01/25/1999/1200UTC:
          USAF dropwinsonde moisture in no longer used in the RGL and GBL analyses.
     10/02/2000/1200UTC:
          The GBL analysis began using radiosonde and PIBAL balloon drift (location and time) information.  
     06/13/2006/1200UTC:
          The RGL analysis (changed to GSI today) is now using radiosonde and PIBAL balloon drift (location and time) information.
     08/22/2006/1200UTC:
          NOAA (P-3 and Gulf Stream) dropwinsonde moisture is now used in the GBL analysis (it is still not used in the RGL analysis, neither analysis uses USAF dropwinsonde moisture).
     12/04/2007/1200UTC:
          NOAA (P-3 and Gulf Stream) dropwinsonde moisture is now used in the RGL analysis (it had already been used in the GBL analysis).  USAF dropwinsonde moisture is now used in the RGL and GBL analyses.
     08/31/2016:
          NOAA Gulfstream-IV is down for maintenance.  It's temporary replacement in operations in NSF-NCAR Gulfstream-V.
     07/19/2017/1200UTC:
          Since NOAA Gulfstream-IV is again available in operations, NSF-NCAR Gulfstream-V is set back to monitor.  NASA Global Hawk temperature and wind is now assimilated in operations (no longer monitored; moisture is monitored in all networks).




IV.  SURFACE (INCLUDING MESONET)  
     
     9/20/1988/1200UTC:
          Splash-level dropwinsonde reports are now used in the RGL and GBL analyses.  
     12/06/1989/1200UTC:
          The wind part of splash-level dropwinsonde reports is no longer processed.  Fixed and moored buoy wind reports with no station pressure are now processed (on 10/02/1991/1200UTC this was restricted to only PMEL-ATLAS buoys in the tropical Pacific).  
     01/30/1991/1200UTC:
          NMC digitized mean sea-level pressure bogus data no longer used by GBL analysis.  (The GBL and RGL analyses still use the OPC/NOS mean sea-level pressure point bogus, usually available in NH only).
     06/25/1991/1200UTC:
          GBL-SSI implementation resulted in mass data from land SYNOP stations and mass and wind data from C-MAN platforms now being used in GBL analysis.  Mass land SYNOP data is already being used in RGL analysis.
     01/31/1997/1200UTC:
          Mean sea-level pressure bogus (PAOBs in GBL and OPC/NOC point in the RGL and GBL) are no longer used in the RGL and GBL analyses.
     02/09/1998/1200UTC:
          RGL-3DVAR implementation resulted in several changes in data usage in RGL analysis: Surface land (SYNOP) wind reports are now being used. Surface land (SYNOP) mass and wind reports within the old LFM grid domain and without pressure are now being used.
     01/09/2001/1200UTC:
          METAR mass and wind data are now assimilated in the RGL analysis.
    04/13/2004/1200UTC:
          Mobil synoptic land mass and wind data (ingested into /dcom BUFR tank b000/xx002) included in "adpsfc" dumps in GBL networks.
     01/25/2005/1200UTC:
          Mobile synoptic land mass and wind data used in GBL analyses (not yet used in RGL analysis, outside of domain anyway).
     06/28/2005/1200UTC:
          Mesonet mass (surface pressure, tenmperature, moisture) data are now assimilated in the RUC analysis (based on "uselist").  METAR cloud/visibility/weather  observations.are now assimilated in the RGL analysis.
     03/31/2008/1200UTC:
          Mesonet wind data are now assimilated in the NAM/NDAS GSI (based on "uselist").
     09/15/2008/1500UTC:
          SYNOPTIC (both restricted and unrestricted) surface land data are now included in the "adpsfc" dump file and the PREPBUFR file in the RUC network (report types 181/281, 183/284).  These data are now assimilated by the RUC analysis.  They will also be used by the future (2009) RapidRefresh system.
     09/16/2008/1200UTC:
          Roadway data from numerous mesonet providers (mainly DOT providers) is now ingested into the applicable /dcom b255 BUFR tanks and subsequently dumped into the "msonet" dump files and encoded into the PREPBUFR files in the appropriate networks [dumps in NAM, NDAS, GFS, GDAS, CDAS, RTMA, RUC and SRUC; PREPBUFR in NAM, NDAS, RTMA, RUC (upper-air)].  It is not yet used by any NCEP analysis (currently mesonet data are assimilated only in the NAM, NDAS RUC and RTMA networks).
     11/17/2008/1200UTC:
          Mesonet wind data are now assimilated in the RUC analysis (based on "uselist").
     12/16/2008/1500UTC:
          The RUC analysis now uses mesonet mass and wind data only from the site in the "msonet" dump file closest to the analysis time (when a site appears at more than one time in the dump file).
     06/22/2010/1200UTC:
          U.S. (block 70, 72 and 74) synoptic land mass and wind data are now on the reject list.  These data will not be assimilated by any NCEP analysis.   Coincident METARS at all of these sites provide better surface pressure data.
     08/17/2010:
          The Australian PAOBs (sea-level pressure bogus) data are no longer produced after this date.  Empty dumps ("sfcbog") continue to be generated in the CDAS, GDAS and GFS networks.  The CDAS has assimilated these data.
     02/08/2011/1400UTC:
          U.S. Coast Guard data are now ingested into /dcom tank b001/xx007.  These are not yet included in any dumps.
     10/18/2011/1200UTC:
          Mesonet mass (surface pressure, tenmperature, moisture) data are now assimilated by NAM/NDAS GSI (subject to both a static "uselist", and a dynamic reject list constructed from RTMA - these lists also now apply to mesonet wind data which had been used prior to this) with one exception (see below).  The mesonet mass data had been monitored.
          Exception: Surface pressure is not assimilated at sites where both it and altimeter setting are missing, in which case surface pressure is estimated from U.S. Standard Atmosphere mean sea-level pressure (mean sea-level pressure is always missing for mesonet reports) and reported temperature and elevation (these sites have an "x" in character 8 of report id).
     02/14/2012/1200UTC:
          The "sfcshp" dumps in all networks now include U.S. Coast Guard reports (from /dcom tank b001/xx007).  These data are not yet read by the PREPBUFR processing and thus are not assimilated by any analysis.  The CDAS, GDAS and GFS networks no longer attempt to dump Australian PAOB (sea-level pressure bogus) data ("sfcbog").  These data have not been produced since 08/17/2010.
     03/29/2012/1200UTC:
          TAO refresh buoys are now decoded into the /dcom BUFR database in tank b001/xx002.
     06/05/2012/1400UTC:
          Unrestricted surface ship reports are now encoded into new /dcom tank b001/xx013.  (Restricted surface ship reports remain in /dcom tank b001/xx001.)  These unrestricted ship reports are now dumped in all networks as part of the "sfcshp" dump.  A new duplicate-checking program, BUFR_DUPSHP, compares reports in tanks b001/xx001 and b001/xx013 are removes all duplicates.  The reports in b001/xx001 are retained when such duplicates are present.  Most of the reports in b001/xx013 duplicate those in b001/xx001.  The unrestricted ship reports making it out of the dump duplicate check are read by the PREPBUFR processing and are assimilated into all analyses that use surface marine reports.
     07/31/2012/1200UTC:
          Mesonet "Climate Reference Network" data are now ingested into /dcom tank b255/xx111.  These are not yet included in any dumps.
     06/24/2014/1200UTC:
          The U.S. Coast Guard reports (from /dcom tank b001/xx007 and included in "sfcshp" dumps in all networks) are now read by the PREPBUFR processing and encoded as report type 180/280 in the PREPBUFR files when surface pressure information is available. These will now be assimilated by all analyses.
     06/24/2014/1200UTC:
          Surface reports with missing pressure will now be stored in report types 192/292 (SYNOP), 193/293 (METAR), 194/294 (marine) and 195/295 (msonet) in NAM, NDAS, RAP, RTMA and URMA PREPBUFR files (these include U.S. Coast Guard reports with missing pressure in report types 194/294).  These are not assimilated by any analysis.
     08/12/2014/1200UTC:
          The NAM/NDAS GSI now assimilates surface observations which lack a pressure report.
     09/11/2014/1800UTC:
          The RTMA and URMA GSI now assimilate surface observations which lack a pressure report.
     08/10/2015/1200UTC:
          Surface marine reports previously, incorrectly deemed over land and flagged will now be deemed over water and be available for assimilation in every network.
     08/23/2016/1200UTC:
          Mesonet mass and wind data are now assimilated in the RAP GSI (assumed they are based on "uselist").  METAR cloud ceiling height (derived from cloud amount and cloud height) is now assimilated by RTMA and URMA GSI.
     11/17/2016/1315UTC:
          BUFR-feed drifting and moored buoys now ingested into /dcom database tanks b001/xx102 and b001/xx103, resp.  These data are not yet dumped in any network.  However, as a result of the 11/01/2016 termination of 90% of the data in TAC-fed FM 18 buoy tank b001/xx002 (which is a part of the "sfcshp" dump), a temporary workaround has been implemented.  This workaround remaps affected reports in bulletin originators LFPW, LFVW and KARS from b001/xx102 and b001/xx103 tanks to b001/xx002 tank to allow these reports to continue to be dumped and assimilated.  Once we are ready to handle the BUFR-feed buoys in tanks b001/xx102 and b001/xx103, this workaround will be removed.
     10/11/2017/1230UTC:
          Mesonet "Urbanet" data are now ingested into /dcom tank b255/xx031.  These are not yet included in the "msonet" dumps.  Mesonet visibility data are now ingested for all networks and are included in the "msonet" dumps (for those types inclded in the dump) however, due to issues in data quality, visibility is not assimilated by any network.
     12/13/2017/1400UTC:
          In the URMA network, the new GLERL-adjustment processing (PREPOBS_GLERLADJ) begins running for selected surface reports in the Great Lakes region as part of the PREPBUFR processing.  Click here for more information.
     02/12/2018/1500UTC:
          Bulletin originators KWBC and CWAO added to list for which BUFR-feed drifting and moored buoys can be remapped into legacy TAC tanks in /dcom. See 11/17/2016/1315UTC change above for more information.




V.  WSR-88D (NEXRAD and TAIL-DOPPLER) RADAR  

     
     6/17/2008/1200UTC:
          Update to the ingest package.  Radial wind quality control significantly upgraded.  New reflectivity quality control added.  Reflectivity Single Radar Coordinate (SRC) flat-files are now generated for the (yet-to-be-implemented) radar reflectivity mosaic processing package to pick up.
     6/17/2008:
          Nearly 90 of the 135 NEXRAD sites over the CONUS have now switched from Build 8 to Build 10 software.  We are still unable to ingest these Build 10 sites, so we are losing ~67% of the Level 2 (and possibly also Level 2.5) radar data.
     09/15/2008/1500UTC:
          Level 3 and Level 2.5 NEXRAD radial wind data are now dumped ("radwnd") in the RUC network.  These data are not assimilated by the RUC analysis.  They will be used by the future RapidRefresh system.
     09/15/2008:
          All 135 NEXRAD sites over the CONUS have now switched from Build 8 to Build 10 software.  We are now unable to ingest any Level 2 radial wind and reflectivity data from these Build 10 sites.  Level 2.5 and 3 radial wind data are not affected.
     10/07/2008/1500UTC:
          We are now again able to ingest Level 2 radial wind and reflectivity data from all 135(?) NEXRAD sites with the implementation of the "supres" ingest code which reads Build 10 and transforms it back into pseudo-Build 8 before ingesting it into /dcom.  These data are again dumped into "nexrad" files in the NAM and NDAS networks and are again being assimilated by the NAM/NDAS GSI.
     11/17/2008/1200UTC:
          The RUC analysis now processes three-dimensional Level 2 radar reflectivity mosaic data which produces a latent heat specification to be used in the model digital filter.
     04/06/2010/1200UTC:
          New Level 2 ingest and QC bundle implemeted.  Improved QC and processes Build 10.
     07/27/2010/1200UTC:
          Two additional hourly ingest job runs have been added for the Level 2 and Level 2.5 NEXRAD radial wind data.  These new run times are at 22- and 50-minutes past the hour.  The ingest now runs four times per hour (the previous run times at 5- and 35-minutes past the hour remain).  With this change, most of the hourly Level 2.5 data centered on the hour are now ingested at 50-minutes past the hour rather than at 5-minutes past the next hour.  This allows the late-cutoff 00 and 12Z RapidRefresh dumps to now see the full complemement of Level 2.5 data (before they saw little, if any, Level 2.5 data; they still do not see any Level 2.5 data at the other hours which have an early-cutoff dump time).  The hourly Level 3 data continue (usually) to be ingested at 35-minutes past the hour. 
     10/18/2011/1200UTC:
          Level 2.5 NEXRAD radial wind data are now used ONLY over Alaska by the NAM/NDAS GSI.  (Level 2 radial winds, which are used over the CONUS, are not available over Alaska.)
     11/20/2012/1200UTC:
          Canadian radar data are now ingested into /dcom.  Data include reflectivity (each hour, centered on 00-23z, encoded into tanks b006/xx080 through xx103, resp.) and radial wind (each hour, centered on 00-23z, encoded into tanks b006/xx110 through xx133, resp.).  These are not yet included in any dumps.
     11/20/2012/1200UTC:
          P-3 aircraft Tail Doppler Radar (TDR) radial wind data are now ingested into /dcom tank b006/xx070.  These are not yet included in any dumps (with the exception of HWRF).
     10/04/2013/1200YTC:
          P-3 aircraft Tail Doppler Radar (TDR) radial wind data assimilated for the first time in the production HWRF system.
     08/23/2016/1200UTC:
          Level 2, 2.5(?) and 3(?) NEXRAD radial wind data are now assimilated by the RAP GSI.
     08/23/2017/1200UTC:
          Level 3 and Level 2.5 NEXRAD radial wind data are no longer assimilated by the NAM and RAP GSI.  The Radar Operation Center is going to remove the WSR-88D super-ob product (Level 2.5 and Level 3 radial wind) in the near future. The Level 2.5 and Level3 radial winds had been used only in the Alaska domain due to there being no Level 2 data available before 2016. The change will have no impact on CONUS domain.

NOTE: Find out if L2 radar reflectivity is assimilated in NAM!! (and if so when?)

    12/02/2008/1500UTC:
          Lightning data from Vaisala's National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN - short range) and Long-range Lightning Detection Network (LLDN) are now ingestred into /dcom database tanks b007/xx001 and b007/xx002, resp.  These data are not yet dumped in any network.
    12/15/2009/1200UTC:
          The GFS/GDAS GSI now assimilates tropical storm pseudo sea-level pressure observations using information in the Q.C.'d tcvitals files. These get a report type of 112 and are written to the post-analysis PREPBUFR files.
     10/18/2011/1200UTC:
          The t-12 NDAS now starts from a global sigma first guess which reflects the relocation of tropical systems (if any are present).
    02/14/2012/1200UTC:
          The CDAS, GDAS and GFS networks now dump the following oceanographic data types: "bathy" [eXpendable BathyThermographs (XBT) and thermistor chain moorings {via GTS, originating from WMO FM-63 (BATHY) format}], "tesac" [Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) probes, Argo profiling floats, moorings {via GTS, originating from WMO FM-64 (TESAC) format}], and "trakob" [ThermoSalinoGraphs (TSG) {via GTS, originating from WMO FM-62 (TRACKOB) format}].  These data are not assimilated by any atmospheric analyses.
    05/01/2012/1200UTC:
          Lightning data from Vaisala's Long-range Lightning Detection Network (LLDN) and National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN - short range) are now dumped by the RAP ("lghtng").  These data are not yet assimilated.
    09/08/2011:
          Lightning data from the Long-range Lightning Detection Network (LLDN) from Vaisala stopped.  It later resumed on 07/17/2013.
    02/25/2014:
          Lightning data from Vaisala's Long-range Lightning Detection Network (LLDN) and National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN - short range) are assimilated by the RAP GSI.
    10/07/2014/1200UTC:
          BUFR-feed marine subsurface data, currently only in the form of glider data, now decoded into BUFR tank b031/xx005.  These data are not assimilated by any atmospheric analyses.
    11/12/2015:
          Vaisala lightning data now encrypted. Lightning data from Earth Networks, Inc. (ENI) Total Lightning Network (ENTLN) are now ingestred into /dcom database tank b007/xx003.  These data are not yet dumped in any network.
    03/21/2017/1200UTC:
          Lightning data from Vaisala's Long-range Lightning Detection Network (LLDN) and National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN - short range) are now dumped by the NAM ("lghtng") and are assimilated by the NAM GSI.
    12/13/2017/1330UTC
          Airborne eXpendable BathyThermograph (AXBT) data now decoded into BUFR tank b031/xx004.  These data are normally generated only during certain NOAA hurricane hunter flights and other special sea-based reconnaissance missions.
    03/21/2017/1200UTC:
          Synthetic mass and wind bogus data in the vicinity of tropical cyclones no longer generated in NAM (SYNDAT_SYNDATA program no longer runs).
    07/19/2018/1200UTC:
          The GFS/GDAS GSI no longer assimilates synthetic wind bogus profiles constructed in the vicinity of tropical cyclones by program SYNDAT_SYNDATA (PREPBUFR report type 210).  These are monitored by the GFS/GDAS GSI but may eventually be shut off.
