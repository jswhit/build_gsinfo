           NOAA-18 AMSU-A channel 9 is no longer assimilated by the NAM/NDAS or GFS/GDAS GSI.  A sudden increase in the noise for both space and warm counts for this channel has been observed.
     03/06/2008/1200UTC:
           NOAA-16 AMSU-A channel 4 has gone bad.  As a result, NOAA-16 ATOVS sounding files are no longer being produced by NESDIS, thus they are no longer in the "atovs" dumps in the GDAS and CDAS networks and they (temperature retrievals) are no longer available for assimilation by the CDAS.  The "atovs" dumps now contain only NOAA-15 ATOVS soundings and only these temperature retrievals (cloudy only) are assimilated by the CDAS.  In addition, the failed channel 4 data has resulted in no NOAA-16 AMSU-A data being assimilated by the NAM/NDAS or GFS/GDAS GSI (even though these files are still being produced by NESDIS and NOAA-16 AMSU-A data continue to be dumped in the "1bamua" files in the CDAS, GDAS, GFS, NDAS and NAM networks).
     03/12/2008/1200UTC:
           The "satinfo" files have been modified to no longer use (and to just monitor) NOAA-16 AMSU-A data in the NAM/NDAS and GFS/GDAS GSI (even though these files are still being produced by NESDIS and NOAA-16 AMSU-A data continue to be dumped in the "1bamua" files in the CDAS, GDAS, GFS, NDAS and NAM networks).  See 03/06/2008/1200UTC note above for more information.
     03/27/2008/1200UTC:
           ATOVS soundings (retrievals) in /dcom database tank b003/xx104 and in "atovs" dump files in GDAS and CDAS networks now contain NOAA-18 and METOP-2 data [replacing NOAA-15 and the now-defunct NOAA-16 (see 03/06/2008/1200UTC entry above)].  The CDAS now assimilates NOAA-18 cloudy temperature retrievals in place of NOAA-15 cloudy temperature retrievals (PREPBUFR processing is not yet ready to handle data from the METOP-2 satellite).
     06/06/2008/1200UTC:
           The CDAS now assimilates METOP-2 clear and cloudy soundings (in addition to existing NOAA-18 cloudy soundings) (PREPBUFR processing can now handle data from the METOP-2 satellite).
     09/15/2008/1500UTC:
           ATOVS AMSU-A ("1bamua"), AMSU-B ("1bamub"), HIRS-3 ("1bhrs3"), MHS ("1bmhs") and HIRS-4 ("1bhrs4") data now dumped in RUC network.  These data are not assimilated by the RUC analysis.  They will be used by the future (2012) RapidRefresh system.
     12/16/2008/1200UTC:
           METOP-2 AMSU-A, MHS and HIRS-4 data now assimilated by NAM/NDAS GSI.
     01/15/2009/1200UTC:
           METOP-2 AMSU-A channel 7 is no longer assimilated by the NAM/NDAS or GFS/GDAS GSI.  A sudden increase in the noise-equivalent delta-t for this channel has been observed in the past week.
     02/09/2009/1022UTC:
           NOAA-N-prime launched and now in afternoon orbit as NOAA-19.
     04/17/2009/2000UTC:
           NOAA-16 AMSU-B brightness temperatures are no longer assimilated by the NAM/NDAS or GFS/GDAS GSI (but they are monitored by both). This is due to a degradation in the quality of channel 19.
     05/2009:
           NOAA-18 HIRS-4, noisy since launch, is declared unusable by NESDIS.
     06/02/2009/000UTC:
           NESDIS declares NOAA-19 operational.  NOAA-19 replaces NOAA-18 as the primary afternoon satellite.  NOAA-19 and METOP-2 (primary morning satellite) now form the NESDIS POES constellation.  (NOAA-18, -17, -15 and -16 provide backup support in that order - we still receive data from these satellites although it can be delayed).  We have not yet moved to operational use of NOAA-19 in any system.
     06/02/2009
           NOAA-15 HIRS-3 data are no longer ingested into /dcom, nor are they included in the "1bhrs3" dumps in the GFS, GDAS, CDAS, NAM and NDAS networks.  This is due to every scan failing calibration checks.  There is a major problem with this instrument.  NCEP has not used these data in any assimilation since 11/2000.
     09/29/2009/1500UTC:
           NOAA-19 HIRS-4, AMSU-A and MHS data are now ingested into /dcom database and are now dumped (included in "1bhrs4", "1bamua" and "1bmhs", resp.) in the GFS, GDAS, CDAS, NAM and NDAS networks.  These are not yet monitored nor assimilated by any network.
     10/27/2009/1200UTC:
           EUMETSAT ATOVS Retransmission Service (EARS, bulletin header "EUMS") AMSU-A, AMSU-B and HIRS-3/-4 data are now dumped in the GFS and GDAS networks into files "esamua", "esamub" "eshrs3", respectively.  These data will eventually be used to fill in gaps in the primary satellite server feed of ATOVS brightness temperature data.  They are currently not dumped in any other network, nor are they monitored or assimilated in any network.
     11/24/2009/1200UTC:
           Some of the Asia-Pacific Regional ATOVS Retransmission Service (AP-RARS, bulletin headers "RJTD", "AMMC" and "NZGP") AMSU-A, AMSU-B and HIRS-3/-4 data are now added to existing EUMETSAT ATOVS Retransmission Service (EARS, bulletin header "EUMS") data in /dcom tanks b021/xx033, b021/xx034 and b021/xx035, and GFS and GDAS network dump files "esamua", "esamub" "eshrs3", respectively.  The combined data are referred to as Regional ATOVS Retransmission Services (RARS).  These data will eventually be used to fill in gaps in the primary satellite server feed of ATOVS brightness temperature data.  They are currently not dumped in any other network, nor are they monitored or assimilated in any network.  We are still awaiting the remaining AP-RARS data (bulletin headers "BAWX", "RKSL", "VHHH" and "WSSS") as well as all of the South American-RARS (SA-RARS) data (bulletin headers "SBBR" and "SABM").
     12/01/2009 (or thereabouts):
           The EUMETSAT ATOVS Retransmission Service (EARS, bulletin header "EUMS") data are no longer being ingested due to a glitch in NCO data flow's bulletin header pattern matching processing.
     12/15/2009/1500UTC:
           NOAA-19 AMSU-A and HIRS-4 data are now assimilated by the GFS/GDAS GSI.  NOAA-19 MHS data are now monitored by the GFS/GDAS GSI.  The NAM/NDAS GSI does not yet use or even monitor any of these NOAA-19 1B data.  The following Regional ATOVS Retransmission Services (RARS) 1C data are now assimilated by the GFS/GDAS GSI: AMSU-A from NOAA-15, NOAA-18 and NOAA-19; AMSU-B from NOAA-15 and NOAA-17.  The following RARS 1C data are now monitored by the GFS/GDAS GSI: AMSU-A from NOAA-16, AMSU-B from NOAA-16.  The NAM/NDAS and RAP GSI do not yet use or even monitor any RARS data (they are not yet even dumped in the NAM, NDAS or RAP networks).
     12/22/2009/1200UTC:
           All NOAA-17 AMSU-B channels which had been set to "use" were changed to "monitor" in the GFS/GDAS and NAM/NDAS GSI due to calibration problems in these channels.
     01/11/2010/1700UTC:
           NOAA-19 AMSU-A channel 8 is no longer assimilated by the GFS/GDAS GSI (it is now only monitored).  A sudden increase in the noise-equivalent delta-t for this channel has been observed in the past two weeks.
     03/16/2010/1400UTC:
           The remaining Asia-Pacific Regional ATOVS Retransmission Service (AP-RARS) bulletin headers ("BAWX", "RKSL", "VHHH" and "WSSS") as well as all of the South American-RARS (SA-RARS) data (bulletin headers "SBBR" and "SABM") not included in the ingest implementation on 11/24/2009 are now added to existing Regional ATOVS Retransmission Services (RARS) AMSU-A, AMSU-B and HIRS-3/-4 data in /dcom tanks b021/xx033, b021/xx034 and b021/xx035, and GFS and GDAS network dump files "esamua", "esamub" "eshrs3", respectively. The EUMETSAT ATOVS Retransmission Service (EARS, bulletin header "EUMS") data are again being ingested into RARS AMSU-A, AMSU-B and HIRS-3/-4 /dcom tanks b021/xx033, b021/xx034 and b021/xx035, and GFS and GDAS network dump files "esamua", "esamub" "eshrs3", respectively. (These had not been available since early December 2009 due to a glitch in NCO data flow's bulletin header pattern matching processing.)  There is no change to what is being assimilated (see notes from 12/15/2009/1500UTC above to determine what is assimilated).
     03/16/2010/1400UTC:
           Regional ATOVS Retransmission Services (RARS) MHS data from all sources are now decoded into the /dcom database in tank b021/xx036.  They are currently not dumped, monitored or assimilated in any network.
     10/05/2010/1200UTC:
           Regional ATOVS Retransmission Services (RARS) MHS data from all sources are now dumped ("esmhs") in the CDAS, GDAS and GFS networks.  They are currently not monitored or assimilated in any network.
     03/28/2011/2300UTC:
           NOAA-15 AMSU-B data are no longer being processed by NESDIS.   The scan motor in inoperable and cannot be fixed. Both the GFS/GDAS and NAM/NDAS GSI had been assimilating these brightness temperatures.  Files are still being created by NESDIS, but all records fail NESDIS' calibration quality checks. NCEP is no longer attempting to process these data as of 06/14/2011/1200UTC.
     05/09/2011/1200UTC:
           NOAA-19 MHS data are now assimilated by the GFS/GDAS GSI (they had been monitored).  GFS/GDAS GSI set to not consider NOAA-15 AMSU-B data any longer.  These data went bad on 03/28/2011 and had not been available since that time.  GFS/GDAS GSI set to no longer monitor NOAA-16 HIRS-3, AMSU-A or AMSU-B data or NOAA-18 HIRS-4 data (these data are no longer considered).
     10/18/2011/1200UTC:
           NOAA-19 AMSU-A and HIRS-4 data are now assimilated by the NAM/NDAS GSI and NOAA-19 MHS data are now monitored by the NAM/NDAS GSI (none had not even been monitored except in parallel) (eventually NOAA-19 MHS data are used by NAM/NDAS GSI, although I don't know when).  NAM/NDAS GSI set to attempt to monitor (rather than attempt to use) NOAA-15 AMSU-B data.  These data went bad on 03/28/2011 and had not been available since that time. At some point they should no longer be considered as with the GFS/GDAS GSI.  NAM/NDAS GSI set to not consider NOAA-17 AMSU-A data any longer (they had been set to "monitor" but these data went bad in October 2003 and have not been available since that time).  NAM/NDAS GSI set to not consider NOAA-14 HIRS-2 and MSU data any longer (they had been set to "use" but these data went bad in September 2006 and have not been available since that time).
     05/01/2012/1200UTC:
          The RAP (which replaces the RUC today) assimlates the following:  NOAA-15, NOAA-18, METOP-2 (A) (and maybe NOAA-19 now, or else at some point after this) AMSU-A data; NOAA-18, METOP-2 (A) (and maybe NOAA-19 now, or else at some point after this) MHS data. METOP-2 (A)(and maybe NOAA-19 now, or else at some point after this) HIRS-4 data; NOAA-17 HIRS-3 data.
     09/17/2012:
           METOP-1(B) launched into morning orbit.
     12/13/2012/1800UTC:
           NOAA-17 HIRS-3 brightness temperatures are no longer assimilated by the NAM/NDAS or GFS/GDAS GSI (but they are monitored by both). This is due to a degradation in the quality of channels 2-20.
    ~10/16/2012:
           METOP-1(B) AMSU-A, MHS, HIRS-4 1B brightness temperatures available on NESDIS' DDS server.  NCEP is not yet processing these data.
     02/19/2013/1200UTC:
           METOP-1(B) AMSU-A, MHS and HIRS-4 1B brightness temperatures ingested into /dcom tanks b021/xx023, b021/xx027 and b021/xx028, respectively, (along with the other pre-existing satellites) and are now included in the "1bamua", "1bmhs" and "1bhrs4" dumps, respectively, in all applicable networks.  All are monitored by GFS/GDAS GSI (not considered by any other systems).  METOP-1(B) uncorrected AMSU-A antenna temperatures ingested into /dcom tank b021/xx123 (along with the other pre-existing satellites) (not dumped or assimilated).
     04/10/2013/12000UTC:
           NOAA-17 decommissioned.
     04/11/2013:
           METOP-1(B) ATOVS soundings (retrievals) available on NESDIS' DDS server.  NCEP is not yet processing these data.
     05/01/2013:
          Regional ATOVS Retransmission Services (RARS) METOP-1(B) AMSU-A, HIRS-4 and MHS 1C brightness temperatures ingested into /dcom tanks b021/xx033, b021/xx035 and b021/xx036, respectively, (along with the other pre-existing satellites) and are now included in the "esamua", "eshrs3" and "esmhs" dumps, respectively, in the CDAS, GDAS, GFS, NAM, NDAS and RAP networks. AMSU-A from "esamua" (only) is  monitored by GFS/GDAS GSI (not considered by any other systems).
     05/30/2013/1700UTC:
          NESDIS is no longer generating ATOVS sounding products from NOAA-15.
     07/03/2013/1800UTC:
          NOAA-19 HIRS-4 brightness temperatures are no longer assimilated by the NAM/NDAS or GFS/GDAS GSI (but they are monitored by both). This is due to a degradation in the quality of most of the channels. (If the RAP GSI had also been assimilating NOAA-19 HIRS-4 data prior to this date, then it too likely would have started monitoring these on this day.  If not, it definitely began monitoring these at some point after this date.)
     08/2013:
          METOP-1 (B) HIRS-4 1B brightness temperatures have degraded in quality.  These continue to be monitored by the GFS/GDAS GSI (not considered by any other systems, eventually they are monitored by NAM/NDAS GSI and RAP GSI, although I don't know when).
     08/20/2013/1200UTC:           
          METOP-1 (B) AMSU-A and MHS data now assimilated by GFS/GDAS GSI (not yet assimilated by NAM/NDAS or RAP GSI).
     10/29/2013/1200UTC:
          No longer attempt to ingest AMSU-B or HIRS-3 data from the NOAA-17 satellite (was decommissioned last April).
     03/27/2014/1400UTC:
          The METOP-2 (A) MHS instrument entered into a fault mode during preparations for the out-of-plane maneuvre and recovery was not successful.  The instrument is to remain OFF until a better understanding of the problem allows further diagnostic commanding to be performed. [Note: METOP-2 (A) MHS resumed operations 05/21/2014/1300UTC.]
     05/01/2014/1200UTC:
          S-NPP designated as the primary afternoon-orbit POES constellation satellite (replacing NOAA-19).
     06/09/2014/1430UTC:
          NOAA-16 decommissioned.
     08/14/2014/1200UTC:
          Regional ATOVS Retransmission Services (RARS) AMSU-A radiances (from "esamua" dump) used or monitored (based on satellite) in same way as satellite-based AMSU-A radiances (from "1bamua" dump) by NAM/NDAS GSI.  I think on this day!! (Also, at some point the same thing happens w.r.t. RARS AMSU-A and RARS MHS in the RAP GSI.)
     09/26/2014/1600UTC:
          METOP-2 (A) AMSU-A channel 8 has degraded.  It is no longer used by the GFS, NAM or RAP GSI.  It is now monitored.
     10/15/2014/1500UTC:
          NOAA-15 AMSU-A channel 6 has degraded.  It is no longer used by the GFS, NAM or RAP GSI.  It is now monitored.
     11/04/2014/1200UTC:
           EUMETSAT ATOVS Retransmission Service (EARS, bulletin header "EUMS") AMSU-B is no longer dumped ("esamub") in the GFS, GDAS, NAM, NDAS and RAP networks.  It has not contained any usable data since 2011.  ATOVS AMSU-B ("1bamub") and HIRS-3 ("1bhrs3") are no longer dumped in the NAM, NDAS and RAP networks.  They had not contained any reports since 2011 and 2013, resp.
     12/15/2014/1700UTC:
          NESDIS is no longer generating ATOVS sounding products from NOAA-18.  The new POES constellation is METOP-B/NOAA-19, replacing METOP-A/NOAA-18.
     10/01/2015/1800UTC:
          NOAA-18 AMSU-A channels 5 and 8 have degraded.  They are no longer used by the GFS, NAM or RAP GSI.  They are now monitored.
     09/09/2016/1410UTC:
          METOP-2 (A) HIRS-4 brightness temperatures are no longer assimilated by the RAP, NAM/NDAS or GFS/GDAS GSI (but they are monitored by all three). This is due to a degradation in the quality of most of the channels while engineering tests continue through 10/4/16.
     03/21/2017/1200UTC:
          METOP-1 (B) AMSU-A and MHS data now assimilated by NAM GSI. [This includes RARS METOP-1 (B) AMSU-A in "esamua" dump]. [At some point prior to this date, METOP-1 (B) AMSU-A and MHS data were assimilated by RAP GSI, including RARS METOP-1 (B) AMSU-A in "esamua" dump and RARS METOP-1 (B) MHS in "esmhs" dump.]
     01/24/2018/1400UTC:
          All files on NESDIS' DDS server migrated to their PDA server.


  OZONE (SBUV-2 AND GOME-2) DATA HISTORY ---
     1998 (??):
           NOAA-09 SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data processing initiated in Global SSI (AVN and FNL) (data in IEEE format in /dcom database).
     06/08/1998/1400UTC:
           NESDIS discontinues TOVS processing.  AVN and FNL networks discontinue assimilation of TOVS ozone for their 1b processing.  They do not switch to RTOVS ozone due to imminent upgrade of 1B which will no longer need ozone.
    ~06/17/1998/1200UTC:
           NOAA-14 SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data from IEEE dumps now assimilated in Global SSI (AVN and FNL).
     03/06/2000/1200UTC:
           Now dumping NOAA-11 SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data from IEEE (not yet assimilated by SSI).
     03/16/2000/1200UTC:

     05/14/2001/1200UTC:
           NOAA-16 SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data from IEEE dumps now assimilated by GBL-SSI.
     09/11/2002/1200UTC:
           NOAA-17 SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data are now included in the various network "osbuv" dump files (they are not yet assimilated by any analyses).  The NOAA-17 data will NOT be included in the operational IEEE dumps. 
     10/29/2002/1200UTC:
           IEEE dumps are no longer generated in AVN or FNL networks.    
     05/14/2003:
           NESDIS stopped making NOAA-11 SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data.
     11/29/2005/1200UTC:
           NOAA-17 SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data now assimilated by GFS/GDAS SSI.
     01/17/2006:
           NESDIS stopped making NOAA-14 SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data.  NOAA-14 SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data no longer ingested into /dcom database or part of "osbuv" dump files.  These data have not been assimilated by SSI for several years.
     12/04/2007/1200UTC:
          NESDIS Version 8 BUFR SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data from NOAA-16, -17 and -18 now dumped into "osbuv8" files in GFS and GDAS networks.  These data replace NESDIS Version 6 BUFR SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data (in existing "osbuv" dump) in GFS/GDAS GSI assimilation (NOAA-18 still not assimilated).
     02/04/2008/1200UTC:
          NESDIS stops producing Version 6 BUFR SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data (both orbital and daily files).  The "osbuv" dumps are no longer generated in the GFS and GDAS networks.  Daily Version 8 BUFR SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data files from NOAA-16, -17 and -18 are now copied into daily /dcom database mobsbfr subdirectory, replacing daily Version 6 BUFR SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data files.
     03/27/2008/1200UTC:
          METOP-2 GOME-2 data now ingested into /dcom database (tank b008/xx012) (not yet dumped or assimilated).
     09/16/2008/1500UTC:
          METOP-2 GOME-2 data are now dumped ("gome") in the GFS, GDAS and CDAS networks.  No  GOME data are yet assimilated or even monitored by any NCEP analysis.
     09/17/2008/1200UTC:
          N-16/17 SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data with profile ozone quality flag 7 (upper level profile anomaly or stray light anomaly) are now assimilated in the GFS and GDAS networks by the GBL-GSI (improves coverage in S.H.).
     10/17/2008:
          NOAA-16 SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data began to exhibit a high bias along with a large increase in error codes.  The problem was traced to a calculated interrange ratio.
     10/21/2008/1800UTC:
          NOAA-16 SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone observations are turned off (w.r.t. assimilation) in the GFS/GDAS GSI in order to prevent degradation of GDAS analyses, GFS forecasts of ozone, and stratospheric temperature.
     10/26/2008:
          NESDIS has deemed the NOAA-16 SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data to again be of good quality.  However, the equator crossing time for N-16 is now past 1700 local, so about 1/3 of the data are flagged for high solar zenith angle and global coverage is very lopsided.  These have not been turned back on in the GFS/GDAS GSI.
     08/25/2009/1500UTC:
          NOAA-19 orbital SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data now ingested into /dcom database (part of existing tank b008/xx011) and included in existing "osbuv8" dumps in the GFS and GDAS networks (not yet assimilated).  Daily BUFR SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data file from NOAA-19 now copied into daily /dcom database mobsbfr subdirectory.
     12/01/2009/1200UTC:
          SBUV-2 orbital nadir profile ozone data are now dumped ("osbuv8") in the NAM and NDAS networks.  These data are not yet assimilated or even monitored by the NAM/NDAS GSI.
     12/15/2009/1500UTC:
          NOAA-18 orbital SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data are now assimilated by the GFS/GDAS GSI.  NOAA-19 orbital SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data and METOP-2 GOME-2 data are now both monitored by the GFS/GDAS GSI.  The NAM/NDAS GSI does not yet use or even monitor any orbital SBUV-2 or GOME-2 data.
     05/09/2011/1200UTC:
          NOAA-19 orbital SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data are now assimilated by the GFS/GDAS GSI (they had been monitored).
     09/17/2012:
          METOP-1(B) launched into morning orbit.
     12/12/2012/0800UTC:
          NOAA-18 SBUV anomaly, rendering the instrument inoperable. Chopper Motor stalled resulting in a sudden increase in current and temperature.  The instrument never came back. (Ingest attempt turned off 10/29/2013/1200UTC.)
     04/10/2013/12000UTC:
          NOAA-17 decommissioned. (Ingest attempt for SBUV turned off 10/29/2013/1200UTC.)
     05/15/2013:
          METOP-1(B) GOME-2 data available on NESDIS' DDS server.  NCEP is not yet processing these data. (They initially had the incorrect BUFR satellite id of 4 when they should have been set to 3.)
     10/29/2013/1200UTC:
          METOP-1(B) GOME-2 data now ingested into /dcom database [tank b008/xx012, along with existing METOP-2(A)] (not yet dumped or assimilated).
     10/29/2013/1200UTC:
          There is no longer any attempt to ingest NOAA-17 and -18 orbital or daily SBUV-2 nadir profile ozone data (these had already been discontinued by NESDIS).
     06/09/2014/1430UTC:
          NOAA-16 decommissioned.
     08/23/2016/1200UTC:
          SBUV-2 orbital nadir profile ozone data are now dumped ("osbuv8") in the RAP network.  These data are not yet assimilated or even monitored by the RAP GSI.
     01/24/2018/1400UTC:
          All files on NESDIS' DDS server migrated to their PDA server.


  SST DATA HISTORY ---

     10/01/2008:
          NAVOCEANO SST retrieval files now include METOP-2 data (in addition to existing NOAA-17 and -18 data). (NESDIS SST retrieval files continue to include NOAA-16, -17, -18 and METOP-2.)
     06/02/2009:
          NESDIS SST retrieval files replace NOAA-16 with NOAA-19 (still include NOAA-17, -18 and METOP-2 data). (NAVOCEANO SST retrieval files continue to include NOAA-17, -18 and METOP-2.)  On 06/09/2009/1200UTC NCEP POES SST retrieval processing was modified to recognize NOAA-19 and drop NOAA-18.
     06/25/2009/2000UTC:
          METOP-2 replaces NOAA-17 in NCEP's generation of physical POES SST retrievals generated from AVHRR brightness temperatures from both NAVOCEANO and NESDIS sources.  NOAA-18 also input, as before.
     07/07/2009:
          NAVOCEANO SST retrieval files no longer include NOAA-17 data (only METOP-2 and NOAA-18 data are now in these files). (NESDIS SST retrieval files continue to include NOAA-17, -18, -19 and METOP-2.)
     12/15/2009/1800UTC:
          NAVOCEANO SST retrieval files now include NOAA-19 data (in addition to existing METOP-2 and NOAA-18 data). (NESDIS SST retrieval files continue to include NOAA-17, -18, -19 and METOP-2.)
     12/13/2010/1700UTC:
          NESDIS SST retrieval files no longer include NOAA-17 data (only NOAA-18, NOAA-19 and METOP-2 data are now in these files). (NAVOCEANO SST retrieval files continue to also include NOAA-18, -19 and METOP-2.)
     10/11/2011/1800UTC:
          NOAA-19 replaces NOAA-18 in NCEP's generation of physical POES SST retrievals generated from AVHRR brightness temperatures from both NAVOCEANO and NESDIS sources.  METOP-2 is also input, as before.
     04/24/2012/1200UTC:
          Albedo is now stored in channel 3 for the morning POES satellites (currently only METOP-2) during the daytime hours (for both NAVOCEANO and NESDIS sources).  AVHRR brightness temperatures continue to be stored in channel 3 for all afternoon POES satellites (currently NOAA-18 and -19) and for the morning POES satellites during nighttime hours.  Prior to this, albedo was erroneously stored as an invalid brightness temperature for the morning POES satellites during the daytime hours.
     09/17/2012:
          METOP-1(B) launched into morning orbit.
     04/10/2013/12000UTC:
          NOAA-17 decommissioned.
     06/09/2014/1430UTC:
          NOAA-16 decommissioned.
     12/01/2015/1200UTC:
          NCEP now ingests NAVOCEANO SST retrieval files (still from NOAA-18, -19 and METOP-2) directly from NAVO rather than via NESDIS intermediate processing.  Data arrives faster.  NCEP no longer ingests NESDIS SST retrieval files (these had been a backup and were not correct anyway).  As a result, NCEP no longer generates physical POES SST retrievals from NESDIS AVHRR brightness temperatures.
     01/24/2018/1400UTC:
          All files on NESDIS' DDS server migrated to their PDA server.

     before 01/22/1989:
           GOES-6 (West satellite) -- Prefix character “B”); GOES-7 (East satellite) -- Prefix character “A”).
     01/22/1989:
           GOES-6 (West) turned off operationally (satellite died).
     after 01/22/1989:
           GOES-7 moved from East to West, then back to East.
     02/12/1992/1200UTC:
           CO2 slicing now used to determine level of satwinds.
     01/05/1994/1200UTC:
           VAS gradient winds turned on in AVN and FNL analyses.
      04/13/1994:
           GOES-8 launched.
      05/25/1995:
           GOES-9 launched.
     01/11/1996:
           GOES-7 (East) turned off operationally (winds no longer produced by NESDIS).
     03/27/1996:
           GOES-8 (East) and GOES-9 (West) both become operational.
      04/27/1997:
           GOES-10 launched.
     12/16/1997/1200UTC:
           Six-hourly low density IR (long-wave) winds replaced by 3-hourly IR (long-wave) high-density winds in ETA and EDAS “satwnd” dumps, and are assimilated by Eta-OI and 3DVAR.  3DVAR also assimilates high-density water-vapor imager cloud-top winds.  SSI still assimilates low-density winds.
     03/02/1998/1200UTC:
           Six-hourly low density IR (long-wave) winds replaced by 3-hourly IR (long-wave) high-density winds in AVN and FNL “satwnd” dumps, and are assimilated by SSI.  SSI also assimilates high-density water-vapor imager cloud-top winds.
     07/18/1998/0400UTC:
           GOES-9 (West) turned off operationally (satellite died).
     07/29/1998/1000UTC:
           GOES-10 (West) became operational in all networks.
      05/03/2000:
           GOES-11 launched.
     05/31/2000/1200UTC:
           Now ingests high-density IR (long-wave), water vapor imager and visible winds from NESDIS BUFR format into /dcom database (not yet dumped or assimilated - still dump and assimilate from OPARCH high density winds).
     07/19/2000/1200UTC:
           IR (long-wave) and water vapor winds in “satwnd” data dump files now originate from NESDIS high-density BUFR-format files rather than from high-density OPARCH files (these are now assimilated). Now include NESDIS visible high-density winds in “satdmp” file rather than CIMMS visible winds (these are flagged in PREPBUFR file and not assimilated.
     08/23/2000/1200UTC:
           Turned off the ingest of IR (long-wave) and water vapor winds from NESDIS OPARCH format (these were no longer dumped or assimilated).
     09/25/2000/1200UTC:
           Turned off the ingest of CIMMS visible winds in /dcom database.  Picture triplet winds from NESDIS BUFR format now ingested into /dcom database (not yet dumped or assimilated).  Water vapor sounder winds from NESDIS BUFR (high-density) now ingested into /dcom database (not dumped or assimilated.  NESDIS -produced GMS IR (long-wave) and water vapor imager winds from NESDIS BUFR now ingested into /dcom database (not dumped or assimilated).
     10/04/2000/1200UTC:
           Turned off ingest of OPARCH picture triplet winds in /dcom database.  The “satwnd” dump is now (today)produced from NESDIS BUFR format picture triplet winds, and these will be assimilated.
      07/23/2001:
           GOES-12 launched.
     04/01/2003/1800UTC:
           GOES-12 replaced GOES-08 as the eastern North American NESDIS geostationary satellite.
     06/07/2005/1600UTC:
           GOES winds from the GTS are now being ingested into /dcom database by the NCO decoder system (the winds from NESDIS server gp12 are still written into the various network PREPBUFR files and assimilated by the operational analyses).
     05/24/2006:
           GOES-N launched and became GOES-13 on 6/4/2006.
     06/21/2006/1800UTC:
           GOES-11 replaces GOES-10 as the operational West satellite.  GOES-11 winds are being assimilated in place of GOES-10.  GOES-12 remains the operational East satellite.
     12/04/2007/1800UTC:
           GOES-12 (GOES-E) data are temporarily not available.  The satellite experienced an anomaly in its attitude due to an oxidizer leak in an attitude thruster following a scheduled North-South station keeping maneuver.  The estimated return to service date for GOES-12 is 12/17/2007. Until then, GOES-10 is being utilized with the GOES-E schedule.
     12/07/2007/0000UTC:
           NCEP began to receive GOES-10 IR (long-wave), visible, water vapor winds in the GOES-E BUFR files from NESDIS' GP12 server.  The NAM/NDAS and GFS/GDAS GSI are assimilating GOES-11 and  now GOES-10 IR (long-wave) and imager water vapor (cloud top) winds and are monitoring GOES-11 and now GOES-10 visible winds.  The RUC is assimilating GOES-11 and now GOES-10 IR (long-wave) and imager water vapor (cloud top and deep layer) winds.
     12/18/2007/0000UTC:
           GOES-12 data once again available, replacing GOES-10 in the GOES-E BUFR files from NESDIS' GP12 server.  The NAM/NDAS and GFS/GDAS GSI are again assimilating GOES-11 and GOES-12 IR (long-wave) and imager water vapor (cloud top) winds and are monitoring GOES-11 and GOES-12 visible winds.  The RUC is assimilating GOES-11 and GOES-12 IR (long-wave) and imager water vapor (cloud top and deep layer) winds.
     12/15/2008/0500UTC:
           GOES-12 (GOES-E) data are not available due to a thruster anomaly.  The estimated return to service date for GOES-12 is uncertain. Until then, GOES-13 is being utilized with the GOES-E schedule.  All NCEP analysis that had been using GOES-12 winds are now using GOES-13 winds.
     01/06/2009/1800UTC:
           GOES-12 returned to service and replaced GOES-13 as GOES-E. All applicable NCEP analysis are again using GOES-12 winds.  (The last GOES-13 winds were processed on 1/06/2009/1600 UTC.)
     05/24/2006:
           GOES-O launched and became GOES-14 on 6/27/2009.
     12/1/2009:
           GOES-10 is decommissioned.
     03/04/2010:
           GOES-P launched and will become GOES-15 when it reaches final orbit.
     04/14/2010/1800UTC:
           GOES-13 replaces GOES-12 as the operational East satellite.  GOES-13 winds are being assimilated in place of GOES-12.  GOES-11 remains the operational West satellite.  
     09/28/2010/1200UTC:
           Data now dumped in the RTMA network (as part of "satwnd") and are now encoded into the PREPBUFR file and IR (long-wave) and water vapor imager (cloud-top and deep layer) winds are assimilated by the 5 km CONUS, and Alaska, Guam, Hawaii and Puerto Rico RTMA runs.
     12/06/2011/1500UTC:
           GOES-15 replaces GOES-11 as the operational West satellite.  GOES-15 winds are being assimilated in place of GOES-11.  GOES-13 remains the operational East satellite.
     05/22/2012/1200UTC:
           The GFS/GDAS GSI now reads in all satellite-derived wind data from the "satwnd" dump files rather than from the "SATWND" messages in the GFS and GDAS PREPBUFR files.  "SATWND" messages are still written to the GFS and GDAS PREPBUFR files but are not used. All other networks that assimilate satellite-derived wind data continue to read these from the "SATWND" messages in their respective PREPBUFR files.  The GFS/GDAS GSI now assimilates JMA water vapor imager cloud-top winds (it had just monitored them).  It continues to monitor JMA water vapor imager deep-layer winds.
     09/23-24/2012:
           The GOES-13 (East) imager instrument (and sounder instrument) has degraded in quality due to an anomaly and went out of service on 09/23/2012/2122UTC. On 09/24/2012/0030UTC, NESDIS began sending GOES-15 (West) data into the East files.  We were then getting duplicate wind data but these were successfully removed in the dumpjb duplicate-checking process.  On 09/24/2012/1745UTC, NESDIS began sending GOES-14 data into the East files.  All NCEP analyses that had used GOES-13 satellite-derived winds were then using GOES-14 satellite-derived winds (effective with the 00z 09/25 GFS and NDAS).  GOES-14 is currently positioned at 105W but will soon begin to drift eastward towards the location of GOES-13 at 75W.
     10/18/2012/1444UTC:
           NESDIS is switching GOES-E satellite back to GOES-13 (from temporary GOES-14, see above).  All NCEP analyses that had previously used GOES-13 (and then GOES-14) satellite-derived winds will again use GOES-13 satellite-derived winds.
     05/22/2013/0340UTC:
           The GOES-13 (East) satellite has been affected by an anomaly which has shut down the imager (and sounder) instruments. The last cycles to receive GOES-13 data were: 00z 05/22 - GDAS, GFS, NAM, 03z 5/22 - NDAS (12z 5/22 tm09), 04z 5/22 - RAP.  On 05/23/2013/0600UTC, NESDIS began the process of sending GOES-14 data into the East files.  All NCEP analyses that had used GOES-13 satellite-derived winds were then using GOES-14 satellite-derived winds (effective with the 12z 05/23 RAP, NAM, GFS and GDAS).  GOES-14 is currently positioned at 105W.  There are no plans now to move GOES-14 from its current position.
     06/10/2013/1545UTC:
           GOES-13 has successfully returned to full operational service imager (and sounder). All operations are nominal. Operational level 2 processing and distribution of GOES-13 resumed at that time.  GOES-14 imager (and sounder) will remain on until 6/12/2013/1534UTC.
     01/28/2014/1200UTC:
           The RTMA GSI now reads in all satellite-derived wind data from the "satwnd" dump files rather than from the "SATWND" messages in the RTMA PREPBUFR files.  "SATWND" messages are still written to the RTMA PREPBUFR files but are not used. Of the other networks that assimilate satellite-derived wind data, only the NAM and RAP continue to read these from the "SATWND" messages in their PREPBUFR files.  All other networks that assimilate satellite-derived wind data now read these from their "satwnd" dump files as opposed to their respective PREPBUFR files.
     05/06/2014/1600UTC:
           NESDIS changed the frequency of their GOES satellite derived winds from 3-hourly to 1-hourly. All networks that dump these data (NAM, NDAS, GFS, GDAS, RAP, RTMA, URMA) have been modified such that only one complete wind set continues to be dumped and assimilated. NESDIS GOES-E and -W shortwave (3.9 micron) "night time" IR Winds are now ingested into /dcom database tanks b005/xx019. These are not yet included in the "satnwd" dumps in any network.
     08/12/2014/1200UTC:
           The NAM/NDAS GSI now reads in all satellite-derived wind data from the "satwnd" dump files rather than from the "SATWND" messages in the NAM and NDAS PREPBUFR files.  "SATWND" messages are still written to the NAM and NDAS PREPBUFR files but are not used. Of the other networks that assimilate satellite-derived wind data, only the RAP continues to read these from the "SATWND" messages in its PREPBUFR files.  All other networks that assimilate satellite-derived wind data now read these from their "satwnd" dump files as opposed to their respective PREPBUFR files.
     01/14/2015/1200UTC:
           NESDIS GOES-E and -W shortwave (3.9 micron) "night time" IR Winds are now dumped ("satwnd") in the GFS and GDAS networks. These are monitored by the GFS/GDAS GSI.  GOES satellite winds are now dumped over a 6-hour window about cycle time in the GFS and GDAS networks, allowing 6 times as much data into the assimilation as before (since winds are hourly).
     08/10/2015/1200UTC:
           NESDIS GOES-E and -W shortwave (3.9 micron) "night time" IR Winds are now dumped ("satwnd") in the NAM, NDAS, RAP, RTMA and URMA networks. These are monitored by the RTMA/URMA GSI.
     11/20/2015:
           GOES-13 sounder went bad.  GOES-13 water vapor sounder winds no longer produced.
     08/23/2016/1200UTC:
           The RAP GSI now reads in all satellite-derived wind data from the "satwnd" dump files rather than from the "SATWND" messages in the RAP PREPBUFR files.  "SATWND" messages are still written to the RAP PREPBUFR files but are not used. All networks that assimilate satellite-derived wind data now read these from their "satwnd" dump files as opposed to their respective PREPBUFR files.
     11/19/2016:
           GOES-R launched.  It became GOES-16 when it reached final orbit on 11/29/2016.
     03/21/2017/1200UTC:
           NESDIS GOES-E (13) and -W (15) shortwave (3.9 micron) "night time" IR Winds are now monitored by the NAM GSI.
     07/19/2017/1200UTC:
           The GFS/GDAS GSI now assimilates GOES-E (13) and -W (15) water vapor imager clear-sky/deep-layer winds from "satwnd" dump file.
     12/18/2017/2100UTC:
           GOES-16 replaced GOES-13 at the GOES-East satellite.  It is stationed at 75.2 degrees West.  NCEP continues to use GOES-13 products.
     12/21/2017/1200UTC:
           GOES-16 (East) AMV's ingested:
                - Infrared long-wave imager (11.2 micron channel) winds are now ingested into /dcom database tank b005/xx030
                - Water vapor imager clear-sky/deep-layer (6.15, 7.0 and 7.4 micron channel) winds are now ingested into /dcom database tank b005/xx031
                - Visible imager (0.64 micron channel) winds are now ingested into /dcom database tank b005/xx032
                - Water vapor imager cloud-top (6.15 micron channel) winds are now ingested into /dcom database tank b005/xx034
                - Infrared short-wave imager (3.9 micron channel) winds are now ingested into /dcom database tank b005/xx039
These are now included in the "satwnd" dumps in the GFS and GDAS networks (only).  They are all set to monitor in the GFS/GDAS GSI.
     01/05/2018/1400UTC:
           The GFS/GDAS GSI now assimilates GOES-16 infrared long-wave imager, water vapor imager cloud-top, and water vapor imager clear-sky/deep-layer AMV's. It now monitors these three products from GOES-13.  There are no changes to the use of AMV's in other networks.
     01/08/2018/1500UTC:
           GOES-13 is turned off.  In the NAM, RAP, RTMA and URMA networks there are currently no GOES-E AMV's (infrared long-wave imager had been assimilated in all GSI's; water vapor imager cloud-top had been assimilated in NAM, RTMA and URMA GSI's and monitored in RAP GSI; visible imager and water vapor imager clear-sky/deep-layer had been monitored in all GSI's; and infrared short-wave imager had been monitored in NAM, RTMA and URMA GSI's). GOES-13 water vapor sounder AMV's had been monitored the GFS, GDAS, NAM and RAP GSI's.
     01/24/2018/1400UTC:
          All files on NESDIS' DDS server migrated to their PDA server.
     03/01/2018:
           GOES-S launched.  It became GOES-17 when it reached final orbit on 03/12/2018.

      07/23/2001:
           GOES-12 launched.
     01/15/2002/1200UTC:
           GOES-08 and GOES-10 11x17 field-of-view clear imager radiance data are now ingested into the /dcom database (into tank b021/xx041).  They do not contain an RPID value.  They are being dumped in the AVN and FNL networks (separate from the other GOES sounding/radiance data here) (not yet assimilated).
     04/01/2003/1800UTC:
           GOES-12 replaced GOES-08 as the eastern North American NESDIS geostationary satellite.
     07/08/2003/1200UTC:
           GOES-10 and GOES-12 1x1 field-of-view cloud top data, generated hourly in dump and mini-PREPBUFR files, is now nudged each-hour by the forecast component of EDAS.

     06/06/2006/1200UTC:
           Implementation of NAM/NDAS GSI discontinues use of GOES 5x5 field-of-view layer precipitable water retrievals (although they are still monitored).  GOES 5x5 field-of-view sounder radiances still read from PREPBUFR file and still used over water only.  The NDAS forecast component no longer (for now) uses the GOES 1x1 field-of-view cloud top data (it is still generated hourly in dump and mini-PREPBUFR files).
     06/21/2006/1800UTC:
           GOES-11 replaces GOES-10 as the operational West satellite.  GOES-11 5x5 field-of-view sounder radiance data, layer PW retrievals and 1x1 field-of-view cloud top data are not yet being assimilated in any NCEP network.  GOES-12 remains the operational East satellite - its 5x5 field-of-view sounder radiance data are being assimilated (over water only) at NCEP.
     02/06/2007/1200UTC: 
           GOES-11 5x5 field-of-view clear layer PW retrievals and 1x1 field-of-view cloud top data are now assimilated by RUC.
     02/21/2007/1200UTC:
           GOES-11 and -12 1x1 field-of-view soundings/retrievals/radiances now ingested in /dcom database (into tank b003/xx003) and dumped in GFS, GDAS, NAM and NDAS networks (dump file "goesfv") [these will never be written into PREPBUFR files, not yet assimilated, 5x5 field-of-view data (originally in dump file "goesnd") are still assimilated from PREPBUFR files].  GOES-11 1x1 field-of-view soundings/retrievals/radiances and experimental ("new-science") cloud top data were mislabeled as satellite id 254 instead of the correct value of 255 from 07/19/2006 until 08/23/2006 and then again starting from sometime between 12/01/2006 and 02/28/2007 until 03/20/2007.
     05/29/2007/1200UTC:
           GOES-11 and -12 1x1 field-of-view sounder radiances over water now assimilated by GFS/GDAS GSI directly from dump file "goesfv" (not yet assimilated by NAM/NDAS GSI). GOES-12 5x5 field-of-view sounder radiances are no longer assimilated over water by GFS/GDAS GSI (GOES-11 5x5 field-of-view sounder radiances were never assimilated by GFS/GDAS GSI, nor were any over land sounder radiances; the NAM/NDAS GSI continues to assimilate GOES-12 5x5 sounder radiances over water).
     12/04/2007/1200UTC:
           GOES-11 and -12 5x5 field-of-view sounder radiances (dump file "goesnd") are no longer dumped or written into PREPBUFR file GFS and GDAS networks.  [These were replaced in GFS/GDAS GSI assimilation by 1x1 field of view sounder radiances (in dump file "goesfv") on 5/29/2007 (see above).]
     12/04/2007/1800UTC:
           GOES-12 (GOES-E) data are temporarily not available.  The satellite experienced an anomaly in its attitude due to an oxidizer leak in an attitude thruster following a scheduled North-South station keeping maneuver.  The estimated return to service date for GOES-12 is 12/17/2007. Until then, GOES-10 is being utilized with the GOES-E schedule.
     12/05/2007/1600UTC:
           NCEP began to receive GOES-10 sounding/retrieval/radiance data in the GOES-E BUFR files from NESDIS' GP12 server.
                In the 1x1 field-of-view files (non-cloud), GOES-10 was incorrectly assigned BUFR satellite id 255 (that of GOES-11) instead of the correct value 254.  Thus, data from both GOES-E and GOES-W was processed as GOES-11 by NCEP.  This caused major problems in the GFS/GDAS GSI resulting in the eventual switching off of the assimilation of all GOES 1x1 field-of-view sounder radiances in the GFS/GDAS GSI effective 12/10/2007/1800UTC.  In the meantime, NESDIS corrected GOES-10 BUFR files to use the proper satellite id 254 effective 12/10/2007/1800 UTC.  The GFS/GDAS GSI will continue to monitor GOES-11 1x1 field-of-view sounder radiances (it does not monitor these data from GOES-10).  Once GOES-12 returns to service, the GOES-11 and GOES-12 radiances will be evaluated carefully before any decision is made to re-introduce them into the GFS/GDAS GSI assimilation.
                In the 5x5 field-of-view files, GOES-10 was correctly assigned BUFR satellite id 254. The NAM/NDAS GSI is now assimilating GOES-10 5x5 field-of-view sounder radiances in place of GOES-12 (it does not assimilate these data from GOES-11).  The RUC is now assimilating only GOES-11 5x5 field-of-view layer PW retrievals (normally it also assimilates these data from GOES-12; it does not assimilate these data from GOES-10).
                In the 1x1 field-of-view cloud top data files, GOES-10 was correctly assigned BUFR satellite id 254. The RUC is now assimilating only GOES-11 1x1 field-of-view cloud top data (normally it also assimilates these data from GOES-12; it does not assimilate these data from GOES-10).
     12/17/2007/1800UTC:
           GOES-12 data once again available, replacing GOES-10 in the GOES-E BUFR files from NESDIS' GP12 server.
                In the 1x1 field-of-view files (non-cloud), GOES-11 and GOES-12 sounder radiances are again being assimilated in the GFS/GDAS GSI effective 12/18/2007/1800UTC.
                In the 5x5 field-of-view files, the NAM/NDAS GSI is now again assimilating GOES-12 sounder radiances (it does not assimilate these data from GOES-11).  The RUC is now again assimilating GOES-11 and GOES-12 5x5 field-of-view layer PW retrievals.
                In the 1x1 field-of-view cloud top data files, the RUC is now again assimilating GOES-11 and GOES-12 cloud top data.
     03/31/2008/1200UTC:
           GOES-11 and -12 1x1 field-of-view sounder radiances over water now assimilated by NAM/NDAS GSI directly from dump file "goesfv". GOES-12 5x5 field-of-view sounder radiances are no longer assimilated over water by NAM/NDAS GSI (GOES-11 5x5 field-of-view sounder radiances were never assimilated by NAM/NDAS GSI, nor were any over land sounder radiances).
     07/11/2008/2000UTC:
           GOES-11 and -12 "new-science" 1x1 field-of-view cloud top data (based on GOES 1x1 imagery) replaces previous GOES-11 and -12 1x1 field-of-view cloud top data (based on GOES 5x5 imagery).  Ingested into /dcom database (into tank b003/xx002), dumped in RUC and hourly networks, written into the RUC PREPBUFR files and the hourly mini-PREPBUFR files, and assimilated by the RUC.
     09/15/2008/1500UTC:
           GOES-11 and -12 5x5 field-of-view clear and cloudy layer PW retrievals and radiances are no longer dumped {"goesnd") in the NAM and NDAS networks and are no longer written into the NAM and NDAS PREPBUFR files (layer PW has not been assimilated since 2006, 5x5 f-o-v radiances have not been assimilated since early 2008 as 1x1 f-o-v radiances have, since that time, been assimilated directly from the "goesfv" dump file).
     09/15/2008/1500UTC:
           GOES-11 and -12 1x1 field-of-view clear layer PW retrievals and radiances replace previous GOES-11 and -12 5x5 clear layer PW retrievals and radiances in the "goesnd" dump files in the RUC network.  The layer PW data are written into the RUC PREPBUFR files (report types 156/158) and assimilated by the RUC (replacing the 1x1 layer PW data here).  The 1x1 GOES radiance data are also written into the RUC PREPBUFR files (report types 164/174) (the 5x5 radiances were not written in the PREPBUFR file) but are not assimilated by the RUC analysis.  They will be used by the future (2012) RapidRefresh system.  This ends NCEP's use of GOES 5x5 field-of-view data in all networks.
     09/23/2008/1200UTC:
           Hourly dump and mini-PREPBUFR files containing GOES 1x1 field-of-view cloud top data (only) are no longer generated.  The NDAS forecast component has not used these data since 06 June 2006.
     12/09/2008/1200UTC:
           GOES-11 and -12 5x5 field-of-view layer PW retrievals, soundings, and sounder radiances are no longer ingested into the BUFR /dcom database on the NCEP CCS machines.  The RUC (the last network to use any of these data) switched from 5x5 to 1x1 field-of-view layer PW on 9/15/2008.  This ends NCEP's association with GOES 5x5 field-of-view data.
     12/15/2008/0500UTC:
           GOES-12 (GOES-E) data are not available due to a thruster anomaly.  The estimated return to service date for GOES-12 is uncertain. Until then, GOES-13 is being utilized with the GOES-E schedule.  Both the NAM/NDAS and the GFS/GDAS GSI are set to monitor GOES-13 sounder radiances.  The RUC PREPDATA parm cards are set to flag GOES-13 layer PW and cloud data for non-use by the RUC analysis.  GOES-13 imager radiances are not being processed (no NCEP analysis considers GOES imager radiance data).
     01/06/2009/1700UTC:
           GOES-12 returned to service and replaced GOES-13 as GOES-E.  The NAM/NDAS and the GFS/GDAS GSI are again assimilating GOES-12 sounder radiances. The RUC analysis is again assimilating GOES-12 layer PW and cloud data.  GOES-12 imager radiances are again being processed (no NCEP analysis considers GOES imager radiance data)  (The last GOES-13 sounder radiances/layer PW were processed on 1/06/2009/1500 UTC.)
     05/24/2006:
           GOES-O launched and became GOES-14 on 6/27/2009.
     12/1/2009:
           GOES-10 is decommissioned.
     04/14/2010/1800UTC:
           GOES-13 replaces GOES-12 as the operational East satellite.  Both the NAM/NDAS and the GFS/GDAS GSI are set to monitor GOES-13 sounder radiances (they had assimilated most sounder radiance channels over water from GOES-12).  The RUC PREPDATA parm cards are set to flag GOES-13 layer PW and cloud data for non-use by the RUC analysis (the RUC had assimilated GOES-12 layer PW and cloud data).  GOES-13 imager radiances are not yet being processed and GOES-12 imager radiances are no longer available (no NCEP analysis considers GOES imager radiance data). GOES-11 remains the operational West satellite - there is no change in what is assimilated, monitored, or not used.
     05/04/2010/1330UTC:
           GOES-13 11x17 field-of-view clear imager radiance data are now ingested into the /dcom database (into tank b021/xx041, along with existing GOES-11 data).  They are now included in the "geoimr" dumps in the GFS and GDAS networks (no NCEP analysis considers GOES imager radiance data).
     12/06/2011/1500UTC:
           GOES-15 replaces GOES-11 as the operational West satellite.  The GFS/GDAS GSI is set to monitor GOES-15 sounder radiances while the NAM/NDAS GSI does not yet consider them (both had assimilated most sounder radiance channels over water from GOES-11).  The RUC analysis is set to use GOES-15 layer PW (the RUC had also assimilated GOES-11 layer PW and cloud data).  GOES-15 imager radiances now replace those from GOES-11 (no NCEP analysis considers GOES imager radiance data). GOES-13 remains the operational East satellite - there is no change in what is assimilated, monitored, or not used from this satellite.
     05/01/2012/1200UTC:
          The RAP (which replaces the RUC today) assimlates the 1x1 (sounder) radiance data from GOES-15 in the PREPBUFR file.  At some point in the future (not sure when) it begins assimilating GOES-15 sounder radiances over water directly from the "goesnd" dump file. GOES-13 sounder radiances are monitored by the RAP GSI.
     05/22/2012/1200UTC:
           GOES-13 and GOES-15 sounder radiances over water are now assimilated by the GFS/GDAS GSI (they had been monitored).
     09/23-24/2012:
           The GOES-13 (East) sounder and imager instruments have degraded in quality due to an anomaly and went out of service on 09/23/2012/1126UTC. On 09/24/2012/0030UTC, NESDIS began sending GOES-15 (West) data into the East files.  We were then getting duplicate sounder radiance and cloud data but these were successfully removed in the dumpjb duplicate-checking process.  On 09/24/2012/1745UTC, NESDIS began sending GOES-14 sounder data into the East files.  The RAP had monitored but not used GOES-13 cloud data from NESDIS.  It will now monitor but not use GOES-14 cloud data from NESDIS. The GFS and GDAS had assimilated GOES-13 sounder radiances.  They will monitor GOES-14 sounder radiances.  The NAM, NDAS and RAP had monitored GOES-13 sounder radiances but will not monitor (much less use) GOES-14 sounder radiances. No NCEP analyses monitor, much less use, any GOES imager radiances. GOES-14 is currently positioned at 105W but will soon begin to drift eastward towards the location of GOES-13 at 75W.
     10/18/2012/1444UTC:
           NESDIS is switching GOES-E satellite back to GOES-13 (from temporary GOES-14, see above).  The RAP will, as before, monitor but not use GOES-13 cloud data from NESDIS (just as it did for GOES-14). The GFS and GDAS had assimilated GOES-13 sounder radiances prior to the switch, but they will now monitor GOES-13 sounder radiances due to degradation in their quality (they had also monitored GOES-14 sounder radiances).  The NAM, NDAS and RAP had monitored GOES-13 sounder radiances prior to the switch and will continue to do so again now (they had not monitored, much less used, GOES-14 sounder radiances).  No NCEP analyses monitor, much less use, any GOES imager radiances.
     05/22/2013/0340UTC:
           The GOES-13 (East) satellite has been affected by an anomaly which has shut down the imager and sounder instruments. The last cycles to receive GOES-13 data were: 00z 05/22 - NAM, 03z 5/22 - NDAS (12z 5/22 tm09), 04z 5/22 - RAP, 06z 5/22 - GFS,GDAS.  On 05/23/2013/0600UTC, NESDIS began the process of sending GOES-14 data into the East files.  The RAP had monitored but not assimilated GOES-13 cloud data from NESDIS.  It will now monitor but not assimilate GOES-14 cloud data from NESDIS (effective 09z 5/23). The GFS and GDAS had monitored but not assimilated GOES-13 sounder radiances.  They will monitor but not assimilate GOES-14 sounder radiances (effective 06z 5/23).  The NAM, NDAS and RAP had monitored but not assimilated GOES-13 sounder radiances. They will not monitor (much less use) GOES-14 sounder radiances (although they are in the dumps effective 09z 5/23 for the RAP and 12z 5/23 for the NAM). No NCEP analyses monitor, much less use, any GOES imager radiances (although the ingest was switched to process GOES-14 instead of GOES-13 at 13z 5/23 and these are available from NESDIS). GOES-14 is currently positioned at 105W.  There are no plans now to move GOES-14 from its current position.
     06/10/2013/1545UTC:
           GOES-13 has successfully returned to full operational service imager and sounder. All operations are nominal. Operational level 2 processing and distribution of GOES-13 resumed at that time.  GOES-14 imager and sounder will remain on until 6/12/2013/1534UTC.
     02/25/2014/1200UTC:
           NESDIS-generated sfov GOES-15 cloud data (cloud-top pressure, total cloud cover, cloud-top temperature) now assimilated by RAP GSI cloud analysis.  GOES-13 is monitored.  METAR cloud data (cloud amount, height of cloud base, present weather, visibility, dewpoint) now assimilated by RAP GSI cloud analysis.
     04/08/2014/1200UTC:
           NESDIS-generated sfov GOES-13 and -15 cloud data now dumped in the NAM and NDAS networks ("goesnd").  Not yet assimilated.
     06/24/2014/1200UTC:
           NESDIS-generated sfov GOES-13 and -15 cloud data now encoded into PREPBUFR files in the NAM and NDAS networks as report type 151.
     08/12/2014/1200UTC:
           GOES-15 sounder radiances over water are now assimilated by NAM/NDAS GSI. NESDIS-generated sfov GOES-15 cloud data (cloud-top pressure, total cloud cover, cloud-top temperature) now assimilated by NAM/NDAS GSI cloud analysis.  GOES-13 is monitored.  METAR cloud data (cloud amount, height of cloud base, present weather, visibility, dewpoint) now assimilated by NAM/NDAS GSI cloud analysis.
     11/20/2015:
           GOES-13 sounder went bad.  GOES-13 sounder radiances and cloud data no longer produced.
     11/19/2016:
           GOES-R launched.  It became GOES-16 when it reached final orbit on 11/29/2016.
     12/18/2017/2100UTC:
           GOES-16 replaced GOES-13 at the GOES-East satellite.  It is stationed at 75.2 degrees West.  NCEP continues to use GOES-13 products.
     01/08/2018/1500UTC:
           GOES-13 is turned off.  In the GFS, GDAS, NAM and RAP networks there are currently no GOES-E imager radiances (these were being monitored by all of these GSI's).  There is no souncder on GOES-16.  Click here for information on GOES-16 & up ABI imnager radiances.
     01/24/2018/1400UTC:
          All files on NESDIS' DDS server migrated to their PDA server.
     03/01/2018:
           GOES-S launched.  It became GOES-17 when it reached final orbit on 03/12/2018.

           Global analyses begin using FNOC wind speed retrievals from F-10, superobed to 1 degree lat/lon.
     05/11/1994/1200UTC:
           Global analyses use both F-10 and F-11 retrievals.
     ??????????????????:

           F-13 (Sat. no. 7 - odd) replaces F-11 in operations.
     02/1997:
           SSM/I scan data ingested into /dcom database (BUFR), dumped and reprocessed into ON29 form of “spssmi” file, with conversion of data processing to Cray.
     11/15/1997:
           F-10 no longer operational (died).
     02/09/1998/1200UTC:
           SSM/I wind speed retrievals (operational Goodberlet algorithm), superobed to 1 degree lat/lon, now assimilated by new Eta/EDAS 3DVAR analysis.
     04/07/1998/1200UTC:
           SSM/I wind speed and total precipitable water in Global PREPBUFR files are now generated by the NN3 algorithm.  Only the wind speed is currently assimilated by the SSI.
     03/02/1998/1200UTC:
           F-14 (Sat. no. 8 - even) becomes operational.
     03/06/2000/2000UTC:

           SSM/I rain rate (superobed) now included in the AVN, FNL and CDAS “spssmi” reprocessed data dump file.  These will eventually be included in the PREPBUFR file and assimilated by the SSI.
     02/12/2001:
           SSM/I rain rate (superobed) assimilated by SSI directly from “spssmi” dump file (not yet included in PREPBUFR file - not yet ready).
     04/24/2001/1200UTC:
           SSM/I rain rate (superobed) now encoded into AVN and FNL PREPBUFR files (these data are still assimilated by SSI directly from “spssmi” data dump file).
     10/18/2003:
           F-16 (BUFR Sat. no. 249) successfully launched.
     06/06/2006/1200UTC:
           Implementation of NAM/NDAS GSI discontinues use of SSM/I total precipitable water retrievals.
     08/15/2006/1330UTC:
           F-15 (BUFR Sat. no. 248) products (wind speed, rainfall rate, wind speed) no longer reprocessed into "spssmi" dump file in ANY network, thus no longer encoded in PREPBUFR file or available for assimilation in ANY network.  Product quality severely degraded due to activation of "RADCAL" by DMSP Satellite Operations Control Center which has severely degraded the quality of the 22 GHz channel.  Does not affect F-13 satellite. (The F-15 brightness temperatures in channels other than 22 GHz are still used for sea-ice analysis.)
     08/24/2008/0300UTC:
          F-14 (Sat. no. 247) failed due to an electrical malfunction.  The spacecraft recorder is inoperable and will remain so until further notice.  F-14 data was not being used by any NCEP network anyway (only F-13 data are used).  It was being ingested into /dcom and dumped.
     09/15/2008/1500UTC:
           New dump files "ssmipn" (SSM/I NN3 products) and "ssmit" (SSM/I brightness temps) now generated in the RUC network.  These data are not written into PREPBUFR nor are they assimilated by the RUC analysis.  They will be used by the future (2009) RapidRefresh system.
     12/02/2008/1500UTC:
           The /dcom ingest is no longer attempting to process F-14 (Sat. no 247) files.  These files have not been available since 08/24/2008 (see above).
     09/29/2009/1500UTC:
           DMSP F-16 and F-17 SSM/IS UPP 1B brightness temperatures now ingested into operational /dcom database (into tank b021/xx201) (not yet dumped or assimilated).
     10/27/2009/1200UTC:
           DMSP F-16 and F-17 SSM/IS UPP 1B brightness temperatures now dumped in GFS and GDAS networks as "ssmisu" (not yet assimilated).
     11/19/2009/0203UTC:
           The final recorder on the DMSP F-13 spacecraft (Sat. no. 246) has failed.  This satellite was the only one remaining that provided SSM/I data to the NCEP analyses.  This is the end of NCEP's use of SSM/I products and brightness temperatures.  In the unlikely event that some stray, degraded data files may still be ingested (prior to a "Request for Change" package to stop attempting to process them which will not be implemented until next month at the earliest), both the GFS/GDAS and NAM/NDAS GSI were modified on 11/24/2009/1900UTC (via convinfo and pcpinfo parm card changes) to no longer assimilate (but only monitor) SSM/I wind speed and SSM/I rainfall rate (the latter was only assimilated by the GFS/GDAS GSI).
     07/06/2010/1200UTC:
           DMSP F-18 SSM/IS UPP 1B brightness temperatures now ingested into operational /dcom database (into tank b021/xx201) and dumped in GFS and GDAS networks as "ssmisu" (along with existing DMSP F-16 and F-17) (not yet assimilated but at some unknown point after this DMSP F-16, -17 and -18 SSM/IS 1B brightness temperatures were all monitored by GFS/GDAS GSI).   
     09/28/2010/1200UTC:
           SSM/I NN3 data no longer attempted to be dumped ("ssmipn") in the RTMA network.  These data dumps have been empty since last November.
     10/05/2010/1200UTC:
           SSM/I NN3 product ("ssmipn"), SSM/I brightness temperature ("ssmit") and SSM/I FNOC product ("ssmip") data no longer attempted to be dumped in the CDAS, GDAS, GFS, NAM, NDAS and RUC networks.  These data dumps have been empty since last November and are now no longer dumped in any NCEP network.
     10/??/2013:
           The quality of the DMSP F-16 SSM/IS UPP 1B brightness temperatures has degraded.  These continue to be monitored by the GFS/GDAS GSI.
     01/14/2015/1200UTC:
           DMSP F-17 and F-18 SSM/IS UPP 1B brightness temperatures are now assimilated by the GFS/GDAS GSI. DMSP F-16 UPP 1B brightness temperatures continue to be monitored by the GFS/GDAS GSI.
     07/02/2015/1800UTC:
           The quality of the DMSP F-18 SSM/IS UPP 1B brightness temperatures has degraded.  These are no longer used in the GFS/GDAS GSI.  They are still monitored.
     08/10/2015/1200UTC:
          DMSP F-16, F-17 and F-18 SSM/IS UPP 1B brightness temperatures now dumped in NAM and NDAS networks as "ssmisu".  These data are not yet assimilated or even monitored by the NAM/NDAS GSI. DMSP F-19 SSM/IS UPP 1B brightness temperatures now ingested into operational /dcom database (into tank b021/xx201) and dumped in GFS, GDAS, NAM and NDAS networks as "ssmisu" (along with existing DMSP F-16 and F-17 and F-18). They are monitored by the GFS/GDAS GSI and not considered by the NAM/NDAS GSI.  At some point after this F-17 SSM/IS UPP btemps are monitored by the NAM/NDAS GSI.
     10/07/2015:
          F-18 SSM/IS UPP btemps are monitored by the NAM/NDAS GSI.
     02/02/2016/1750UTC:
           The SSM/IS instrument on DMSP F-16 is no longer functional.  These data are no longer available (or at least they are no longer being processed by NCEP).
     02/11/2016:
           The SSM/IS instrument on DMSP F-19 experienced an anomaly and is currently not being processed.  Future status is unclear.  These data are not considered by any NCEP system. (Note: Turned off attempt to pull this file 09/07/2016.)
     08/23/2016/1200UTC:
          DMSP F-18 SSM/IS UPP 1B brightness temperatures now dumped in RAP network as "ssmisu".  These data are not yet assimilated or even monitored by the RAP GSI. 
     03/21/2017/1200UTC:
          DMSP F-17 SSM/IS UPP 1B brightness temperatures are now assimilated by the NAM GSI.

           90-minute ELW IR (long-wave), visible and water vapor wind generation moved ahead 1-hour by EUMETSAT.  Winds are now produced at 0000, 0130, 0300, 0430, 0600, 0730, 0900, 1030, 1200, 1330, 1500, 1630, 1800, 1930, 2100 and 2230 UTC.
     08/20/2002/1200UTC:
           The time window for processing into PREPBUFR file is changed from -1.75 to -0.25 hours about cycle time to -0.75 to +0.75 hours about cycle time in response to EUMETSAT's change on 07/01/2002/1200UTC.
     08/28/2002:
           MSG-1 (METEOSAT-8) launched.
     06/07/2005/1600UTC:
           High-resolution visible and water vapor winds are ingested into /dcom database (not yet dumped or assimilated).
     12/21/2005:
           MSG-2 (METEOSAT-9) launched.
     06/16/2006:
           METEOSAT-7 winds (all types) no longer available from EUMETSAT.  METEOSAT-8 winds are about to be tested from /dcomdev - not in /dcom database yet.
     02/06/2007/1200UTC:
           METEOSAT-5 high-resolution visible and water vapor winds are now dumped.  The visible winds are assimilated, the water vapor winds are flagged so as to not be assimilated.  METEOSAT-8 winds continue to be ingested into /dcomdev (they are not yet dumped or assimilated but are being tested in the GSI).
     02/13/2007:
           METEOSAT-7 replaces METEOSAT-5 as the east satellite.
     02/15/2007/1800UTC:
           METEOSAT-8 winds are now ingested in /dcom database and dumped and encoded into NAM and GBL PREPBUFR (they are monitored but not used by the NAM/NDAS GSI, they are not used by the GBL-SSI).
     04/11/2007/1300UTC:
           METEOSAT-9 replaces METEOSAT-8 as the west satellite.  NCEP data processing is set up to not yet use MSG winds (see 02/15/2007 above), but METEOSAT-9 IR (long-wave) and visible winds were inadvertently being used in the NAM/NDAS GSI and GBL-SSI after the switch from METEOSAT-8.  A CRISIS change to the dump processing on 0000UTC 13 April now fools the data processing codes into thinking METEOSAT-9 is METEOSAT-8, so the MSG winds are again not being used by these assimilation systems.
     04/17/2007/1200UTC:
           NCEP data processing codes can now handle METEOSAT-9, thus codes are no longer fooled into thinking METEOSAT-9 is METEOSAT-8.  METEOSAT-9 is now dumped and encoded into PREPBUFR (like METEOSAT-8, they are monitored but not used by the NAM/NDAS GSI, and they are not used by the GBL-SSI).
     12/03/2007/1800UTC:
           EUMETSAT stops sending METEOSAT-9 data (temporarily) while METEOSAT-9 undergoes routine spacecraft decontamination.  EUMETSAT swapped METEOSAT-9 with METEOSAT-8 during this time, but the METEOSAT-8 data are not getting into the /dcom database for reasons unknown.  (Later it was discovered that NCO dataflow was not looking for the METEOSAT-8 bulletins - this was corrected on 06/17/2008.) MSG is monitored by the GFS/GDAS and NAM/NDAS GSI so this is not critical.
     12/11/2007/1200UTC:
           EUMETSAT begins sending METEOSAT-9 data again as spacecraft decontamination is complete. It is being received in the /dcom database.  We never did receive METEOSAT-8 data during the swap period (see 12/03/2007/1800UTC above).
     05/13/2008/2045UTC:
           EUMETSAT stops sending METEOSAT-9 data (temporarily) do to an anomaly in the spacecraft.  EUMETSAT swapped METEOSAT-9 with METEOSAT-8 during this time, but the METEOSAT-8 data are not getting into the /dcom database for reasons unknown.   (Later it was discovered that NCO dataflow was not looking for the METEOSAT-8 bulletins - this was corrected on 06/17/2008.) MSG is monitored by the GFS/GDAS and NAM/NDAS GSI so this is not critical.
     05/19/2008/1000UTC:
           EUMETSAT begins sending METEOSAT-9 data again as spacecraft anomaly issue is corrected. It is being received in the /dcom database.  We never did receive METEOSAT-8 data during the swap period (see 05/13/2008/2045UTC above).
     06/17/2008/1200UTC:
           NCO dataflow made a change such that we will now receive METEOSAT-8 data and it should be tanked in the /dcom BUFR database if it ever again replaces METEOSAT-9.  Recall the last two times this happened (12/03/2007 through 12/11/2007 and 05/13/2008 through 05/19/2008) we did not receive METEOSAT-8 data.
     09/15/2008/1500UTC:
          IR (long-wave), visible and water vapor winds from METEOSAT-7 and -9 are now included in the "satwnd" dump file and the PREPBUFR file in the RUC network (report type 243/253/254).  These data are not assimilated by the RUC analysis.  They will be used by the future (2009) RapidRefresh system.
     12/01/2008/1200UTC:
          EUMETSAT stops sending METEOSAT-9 data (temporarily) while METEOSAT-9 undergoes routine spacecraft decontamination.  EUMETSAT swapped METEOSAT-9 with METEOSAT-8 during this time, but the METEOSAT-8 data are not getting into the /dcom database for reasons unknown.  (Later it was discovered that NCO dataflow was not looking for the METEOSAT-8 bulletins - this was corrected on 12/16/2008.) MSG is monitored by the GFS/GDAS and NAM/NDAS GSI so this is not critical.
     12/09/2008/1200UTC:
          EUMETSAT begins sending METEOSAT-9 data again as spacecraft decontamination is complete. It is being received in the /dcom database.  We never did receive METEOSAT-8 data during the swap period (see 12/01/2008/1200UTC above).
     04/17/2009/0900UTC:
          EUMETSAT stops sending METEOSAT-9 data (temporarily) due to a spurious event onboard METEOSAT-9.  EUMETSAT swapped METEOSAT-9 with METEOSAT-8 at this time and METEOSAT-8 data are getting into the /dcom database. MSG (both METEOSAT-8 and -9) is monitored by the GFS/GDAS and NAM/NDAS GSI.  The swap back to METEOSAT-9 occurred 04/23/2009/0900UTC.
     08/15/2009/1000UTC:
          EUMETSAT stops sending METEOSAT-9 data (temporarily) due to a spurious event onboard METEOSAT-9.  EUMETSAT swapped METEOSAT-9 with METEOSAT-8 at this time and METEOSAT-8 data are getting into the /dcom database. MSG (both METEOSAT-8 and -9) is monitored by the GFS/GDAS and NAM/NDAS GSI.  The swap back to METEOSAT-9 occurred 08/21/2009/0800UTC.
     12/15/2009/1500UTC:
          METEOSAT-9 IR (long-wave) and visible winds are now assimilated by the GFS/GDAS GSI.  METEOSAT-9 water vapor winds continue to be monitored by the GFS/GDAS GSI.  The NAM/NDAS GSI continues to monitor METEOSAT-9 IR (long-wave), visible and water vapor winds.  The GFS/GDAS and NAM/NDAS GSI continue to monitor METEOSAT-8 IR (long-wave), visible and water vapor winds.
     09/28/2010/1200UTC:
          Data now dumped in the RTMA network (as part of "satwnd") and are now encoded into the PREPBUFR file and IR (long-wave) and visible winds from METEOSAT-7 are assimilated by the 5 km CONUS, and Alaska, Guam, Hawaii and Puerto Rico RTMA runs.
     07/05/2012:
          MSG-3 (METEOSAT-10) launched.
     01/21/2013:
          METEOSAT-10 replaces METEOSAT-9 as the west satellite.
     01/25/2013/1200UTC:
          The GFS/GSI is now assimilating METEOSAT-10 AMV's.
     08/12/2014/1200UTC:
          The NAM/NDAS GSI is now assimilating METEOSAT-10 AMV's.
     01/14/2015/1200UTC:
          METEOSAT-7 and -10 AMV's are now assimilated for each hour in the existing 6-hour window about cycle time in the "satwnd" dump in the GFS and GDAS networks, allowing 6 times as much data into the assimilation as before.  It appears that METEOSAT-7 and -10 cloud-top water vapor imager winds are being assimilating by this time in the GFS/GDAS GSI (?).
     07/15/2015:
          MSG-4 (METEOSAT-11) launched.
     02/01/2017:
          METEOSAT-8 replaces METEOSAT-7 as the east satellite.  NCEP continues to assimilate METEOSAT-7 AMV's and now monitor METEOSAT-8 AMV's with the exception of the RAP/GSI which assimilates all METEOSAT AMV's (-7, -8 and -10).
     03/08/2017/1400UTC:
          The GFS/GSI is now assimilating METEOSAT-8 AMV's and monitoring METEOSAT-7 AMV's.
     03/21/2017/1200UTC:
          METEOSAT-10 water vapor imager cloud-top AMV's are now assimilated by the NAM GSI (they had been monitored).
     03/31/2017/0900UTC:
          METEOSAT-7 mission ends.  NCEP assimilates its successor METEOSAT-8 (and-10 as before) AMV's in the GFS/GDAS GSI and RAP/GSI, but continues to monitor METEOSAT-8 AMV's in the NAM/GSI (which does continue to use METEOSAT-10 AMV's).  Unsure when NAM will begin using METEOSAT-8 AMV's.
     02/06/2018:
          METEOSAT-11 AMV's are now ingested into /dcom tanks b005/xx064-xx066.  They are also included in the "satwnd" dumps (for all networks that include EUMETSAT AMV's here).  All AMV products from METEOSAT-11 are currently monitored in all networks (METEOSAT-10 remains the operational west satellite and its AMV products are still assimilated).
     02/20/2018/1200UTC:
          METEOSAT-11 officially replaces METEOSAT-10 as the west (0 degree) satellite.  We continue to use METEOSAT-10 AMV's in productiom and monitor METEOSAT-11 AMV's.
     02/28/1700UTC:
          METEOSAT-11 AMV's replace METEOSAT-10 in production (GFS, GDAS, NAM and RAP).  We will continue to monitor METEOSAT-10 AMV's (GFS, GDAS and NAM) until they are turned off by EUMETSAT.
     03/06/2018:
          METEOSAT-10 turned off by EUMETSAT.

     ?????????????????? (prior to 1986):
          We receive 6-hour SATOB format IR (long-wave) and visible winds (they are assimilated).
     02/1997:
           IR (long-wave) and visible wind data ingested into /dcom database (BUFR) and dumped with conversion of data processing to Cray.
     early 2000:
           Began ingesting and dumping 6-hour SATOB format water vapor winds (not assimilated).
     06/07/2005/1600UTC:
           High-density winds coming in GTS-BUFR now ingested in /dcom database (will eventually replace low-density SATOB winds which are still dumped and assimilated).
     07/15/2005/0600 UTC:
           MTSAT-1R replaces GOES-9.
     12/04/2007/1200UTC:
           High-density winds coming in GTS-BUFR are now dumped in "satwnd" file and are assimilated. These replace the low-density winds coming in SATOB format which are expected to be discontinued soon by JMA.  (They are still being ingested in /dcom database for the time being.)
     09/15/2008/1500UTC:
           IR (long-wave), visible and water vapor winds are now included in the "satwnd" dump file and the PREPBUFR file in the RUC network (report type 242/252/250).  These data are not assimilated by the RUC analysis.  They will be used by the future (2009) RapidRefresh system.
     11/15/2009/1200UTC:
           Data outage (all types) began.  Per JMA, due to the failure of image data processing on the MTSAT-1R ground system.  JMA has switched to MTSAT-2 for this processing but we are not getting these data. JMA will announce when the data processing system of MTSAT-1R is recovered.
     11/27/2009/0330UTC:
           JMA resumed wind production (all types) from MTSAT-1R.  NCEP is again receiving and assimilating applicable data.
     08/11/2010/0000UTC:
           MTSAT-2 replaces MTSAT-1R.  A "bug" in the dump processing codes prevented all MTSAT-2 wind reports from being encoded into the appropriate network PREPBUFR files (although they were encoded in the "satwnd" dump files).  Thus none were assimilated.  This was not corrected until 09/30/2010/2000UTC.  
     09/28/2010/1200UTC:
           Data now dumped in the RTMA network (as part of "satwnd") and are now encoded into the PREPBUFR file and IR (long-wave) and visible winds are assimilated by the 5 km CONUS, and Alaska, Guam, Hawaii and Puerto Rico RTMA runs.
     10/07/2010/0600UTC:
           JMA switched from MTSAT-2 to MTSAT-1R due to failure of image data processing on the MTSAT-2 ground data processing system. This was corrected on 10/12/2010 but JMA will not switch back to MTSAT-2 until 12/22/2010.  NCEP is assimilating MTSAT-1R in place of MTSAT-2.
     12/22/2010/0300UTC:
           JMA switched from MTSAT-1R back to MTSAT-2.  NCEP is again assimilating MTSAT-2.
     03/03/2011/0300UTC:
           NCEP started receiving hourly satellite-derived winds from JMA.  They had been produced every three hours.     
     11/01/2011/0300UTC:
           JMA temporarily switched from MTSAT-2 to MTSAT-1R in order to perform ground system maintenance.  NCEP is assimilating MTSAT-1R in place of MTSAT-2.
     12/26/2011/0300UTC:
           JMA switched from MTSAT-1R back to MTSAT-2.
     10/18/2012/0300UTC:
           JMA temporarily switched from MTSAT-2 to MTSAT-1R in order to perform ground system maintenance.  NCEP is assimilating MTSAT-1R in place of MTSAT-2.
     12/26/2012/0300UTC:
           JMA switched from MTSAT-1R back to MTSAT-2.
     10/22/2013/0300UTC:
           JMA temporarily switched from MTSAT-2 to MTSAT-1R in order to perform ground system maintenance.  NCEP is assimilating MTSAT-1R in place of MTSAT-2.
     12/19/2013/0200UTC:
           JMA switched from MTSAT-1R back to MTSAT-2.
     10/07/2014:
           Himawari-8 is launched.
     11/10/2014/0300UTC:
           JMA temporarily switched from MTSAT-2 to MTSAT-1R in order to perform ground system maintenance.  NCEP is assimilating MTSAT-1R in place of MTSAT-2.
     11/28/2014/0200UTC:
           JMA switched from MTSAT-1R back to MTSAT-2.
     07/07/2015/0200UTC:
           JMA has switched from MTSAT-2 to Himawari-8 as its operational goestationary satellite for AMV's. We still use MTSAT-2 AMV's as they are still available on GTS.  We are now testing Himawari-8 AMV's in GFS-GSI.
     03/15/2016/1200UTC:
           Himawari-8 replaces MTSAT-2.
     11/02/2016:
           Himawari-9 is launched.
     03/21/2017/1200UTC:
           Himawari-8 water vapor imager cloud-top AMV's are now assimilated by the NAM GSI (they had been monitored).

          INSAT-3A  - 470
          KALPANA-1 - 440
          INSAT-3D - 471

     ?????????????????? (prior to 1986):
          We receive 6-hour SATOB format IR (long-wave) and visible winds (do not assimilate as data are bad).
     02/1997:
           IR (long-wave) and visible wind data ingested into /dcom database (BUFR) and dumped with conversion of data processing to Cray.
     ~2003:
          Winds no longer being received at NCEP.  Appears to be a problem with INSAT's coding of the date group.
     03/2006:
          NCEP began receiving IR (long-wave) winds from INSAT-3A and from KALPANA-1 (these are dumped and written into PREPBUFR but are not assimilated by any analyses.
     2007-2008(?):
          At some point NCEP stopped receiving IR (long-wave) winds from both INSAT-3A and from KALPANA-1.  Not sure when or why.
     2013-07-26:
          INSAT-3D is launched.
     2018-02-03:
          INSAT-3D AMV's are now being encoded into /dcomdev tanks b005/xx024 (IR-longwave), b005/xx025 (visible), b005/xx026 (water vapor imager). The GSI group will evaluate them.  These should be promoted to /dcom "soon".

           ERS-1 scatterometer wind data assimilated directly into global analysis (bypassing PREPDA files).
     10/25/1995/1200UTC:
           ERS-1 scatterometer wind data now merged into PREPBUFR file, still not processed by PREPDATA.  Global analysis reads PREPDA file.
     11/05/1997/1200UTC:

     10/16/2001/1200UTC:
           Total and convective rain rate now assimilated by AVN and FNL SSI analyses.
     11/20/2001/1200UTC:
           The AVN, FNL and CDAS dump jobs now reprocess these data into q.c.’d, superobed reports.  The AVN and FNL analysis are not yet reading these data (they are still assimilating data in the original dump file and thinning the data).
     10/29/2002/1200UTC:
           The AVN and FNL SSI analysis are now assimilating the reprocessed, superobed, total and convective rain rate reports.
     06/26/2012/1200UTC:
           Migrated from NASA's V6 to V7 real time TRMM/TMI format for total and convective rain rate data.  V7 has improved science, but cloud liquid water and cloud ice water are not available in the TRMM TMI V7 real time data.  (NASA promoted TRMM V7 NRT to "operational" on 12/01/2011 and will stop TRMM V6 NRT product generation on 06/30/2012.)
     10/11/2013/1700UTC:
           The GFS and GDAS analyses are no longer assimilating, but rather only monitoring, TRMM/TMI total and convective rain rate. Their quality has degraded.
     01/14/2015/1200UTC:
           TRMM/TMI data are no longer dumped ("trmm") in the GFS and GDAS networks.  The satellite is nearing the end of its useful life and the data are corrupted.
     08/10/2015/1200UTC:
           TRMM/TMI data are no ingested into the /dcom database tank b012/xx013. The satellite is nearing the end of its useful life and the data are corrupted.  NESDIS turned off their processign of these data on 04/08/2015.

           Warmest/clearest field-of-view AIRS and AMSU-A brightness temperatures now are now dumped ("airswm") in the GFS, GDAS and CDAS networks (not yet monitored or assimilated). AMSR-E brightness temperatures now dumped ("amsre") in the GFS, GDAS and CDAS networks (not yet monitored or assimilated).
     02/21/2007/1200UTC:
           Every field-of-view AIRS and AMSU-A brightness temperatures now ingested into operational /dcom database (into tank b021/xx249) and dumped in GFS, GDAS, NAM and NDAS networks (not yet assimilated).
     03/27/2007/2100UTC:
           Center field-of-view AIRS channel 453 turned off in GFS/GDAS SSI assimilation due to a significant degradation in its quality over past 24-hours (this channel is still monitored by SSI).
     05/01/2007/1200UTC:
           Every field-of-view AIRS and AMSU-A brightness temperatures replaced center field-of-view AIRS and AMSU-A in GFS and GDAS networks (Global-GSI became operational today).
     08/07/2007/1200UTC:
           Center field-of-view and warmest field-of-view AIRS and AMSU-A brightness temperatures no longer dumped in GFS or GDAS networks.
     08/13/2007/1700UTC:
           Center field-of-view and warmest field-of-view AIRS and AMSU-A brightness temperatures no longer ingested into operational /dcom database.
     04/18/2008:
           AQUA AMSU-A channel 4 went bad.  Since this channel is used to QC all of the AQUA AMSU-A channel data, this essentially meant that beginning at this point the GBL-GSI was not using any AQUA AMSU-A data.
     04/22/2008/1200UTC:
           Every field-of-view AIRS brightness temperatures now assimilated by NAM/NDAS GSI (AMSU-A also switched on in NAM/NDAS GSI but not actually assimilated due to issue just above).
     09/15/2008/1500UTC:
          Every field-of-view AIRS and AMSU-A brightness temperatures ("airsev") now dumped in RUC network.  These data are not assimilated by the RUC analysis.  They will be used by the future (2011) RapidRefresh system.
     09/17/2008/1200UTC:
          Reintroduce assimilation of (good) AQUA AMSU-A channel 6 and 8-13 brightness temperatures in the GFS and GDAS networks by the GBL-GSI.  (AQUA AMSU-A brightness temperatures have not been assimilated since AMSU-A channel 4 went bad in April of 2008, see above.)  AQUA AMSU-A brightness temperatures still not assimilated in NAM-GSI.
     12/16/2008/1200UTC:
          AQUA AMSU-A brightness temperatures are set to be monitored in NAM-GSI.  (These had not been assimilated or monitored due to issue noted on 04/18/2008).
     02/24/2009/1200UTC:
          The GFS/GDAS GSI now assimilates a reduced number of AIRS water vapor channels.
     01/09/2010/1200UTC:
          The AIRS (and AMSU-A?) data flow stopped.  The problem is related to a power supply anomaly.  The outage may last for several weeks.
     01/27/2010/1740UTC:
          AIRS d(and AMSU-A?) data flow resumed.
     10/04/2011/0658UTC:
          AMSR-E instrument stopped working. No data is being processed.  Its future is in doubt.  Stay tuned ...  (update: these data are gone forever)
     10/18/2011/1200UTC:
          AQUA AMSU-A brightness temperatures (the good data in channels 6 and 8-13) are now assimilated by the NAM/NDAS GSI (they had been monitored).
     02/14/2012/1200UTC:
          AMSR-E brightness temperatures no longer dumped ("amsre") in CDAS, GDAS or GFS networks.  Data have not been processed since 10/04/2011.  If the data returns, these will again be dumped in these networks (update: these data are gone forever).  These had not been assimilated.
     01/24/2018/1400UTC:
          All files on NESDIS' DDS server migrated to their PDA server.


  SST DATA HISTORY ---


     08/02/2011/1200 UTC:
          AMSR-E NCDC/MISST ocean surface swath products (SST) data now ingested into /dcom database (tank b012/xx034) (began being used in SST analysis on 10/11/2011).
     10/04/2011/0658UTC:
          AMSR-E instrument stopped working. No SST products are being processed in tank b012/xx034.  Its future is in doubt.
     01/09/2013/1700UTC:
          The job to ingest AMSR-E NCDC/MISST ocean surface swath products (SST) data has been removed from production.  This instrument stopped working of 10/04/2011.




XII. GPS-IPW/ZTD DATA (GROUND-BASED, FROM GPS-SERIES SATELLITES)  

     07/16/2002:
           U.S. GPS-IPW data (from NOAA/FSL) now dumped in the CDAS, RUC2A, EDAS and ETA networks (not yet written into PREPBUFR files or assimilated by the EDAS/ETA 3DVAR or the RUC OI analyses).
     06/28/2005/1200UTC:
           RUC2A 3DVAR analysis begins assimilating the U.S. GPS-IPW data.
     06/20/2006/1200UTC:
           NAM/NDAS GSI analysis begins assimilating the U.S. GPS-IPW data.
     02/21/2007/1200UTC:
           U.S. GPS-IPW data are dumped in the GFS and GDAS networks (not yet written into PREPBUFR files or assimilated in these networks).
     12/04/2007/1200UTC:
           Now written into PREPBUFR files in GFS and GDAS networks and monitored (but not yet used) by the GFS/GDAS GSI.
     09/07/2016/1300UTC:
           U.S. ground-based GPSMet (GPS-IPW and ZTD) (from ENI) and European GNSS (GPS-IPW and ZTD) now ingested into /dcom database (tank b012/xx004).  Currently not dumped or assimilated. These will soon replace U.S. GPS-IPW/ZTD data (from NOAA/GSD) which are in /dcom database (tank b012/xx003) in the "gpsipw" dumps and PREPBUFR files.
     09/27/2016/1200UTC:
           U.S. ground-based GPSMet (GPS-IPW and ZTD) (from ENI) and European GNSS (GPS-IPW and ZTD) (from /dcom database tank b012/xx004) have replaced legacy U.S. GPS-IPW/ZTD data (from NOAA/GSD) (from /dcom database tank b012/xx003) in the "gpsipw" dumps and PREPBUFR files in the NAM, NDAS, RAP, GFS and GDAS networks.  Currently only reports from ENI (mainly over U.S.) are encoded into PREPBUFR files and the time window is reduced to be only 3-minutes about cycle time.  European GNSS reports are skipped at this time. The IPW data continue to be used by the NAM/NDAS and RAP GSI and monitored by the GFS/GDAS GSI.  The ZTD data (where available) are encoded into the PREPBUFR files but are not considered by any analyses.
     10/03/2016:
           U.S. GPS-IPW/ZTD data (from NOAA/GSD) are no longer available and the dBNet decoder that wrote these data into /dcom database tank b012/xx003 has been shut down.
     04/05/2017/1600UTC:
           U.S. ground-based GPSMet (GPS-IPW and ZTD) (from ENI) were changed from use to monitor in the NAM and RAP GSI.  Some type of corruption in these data has caused a severe degradation in these analyses of moisture during a potential high-impact severe weather event. (Update 01/09/2018: These have been assimilated in the parallel RAPv4/HRRRv3 without any issues.  If this continues, they will be re-introduced in the RAP GSI when the RAPv4/HRRRv3 is implemented in May 2018.  Since the NAM is frozen, it is uncertain if these data will ever be re-introduced in the NAM GSI.)

           MODIS IR (long-wave) and WV winds now ingested into operational /dcom database (into tanks b005/xx070 and b005/xx071, respectively).  In GFS and GDAS networks only: dumped into the "satwnd" files and included in the PREPBUFR files.  Not yet assimilated by the SSI. 
     11/29/2005/1200UTC:
           MODIS IR (long-wave) and WV (cloud-top and deep-layer) winds now assimilated by GFS/GDAS SSI.
     02/06/2007/1200UTC:
           MODIS IR (long-wave) and WV (cloud-top and deep-layer) winds are now quality controlled according to the NESDIS Recursive Filter Function (RFF) value read in (as with the GOES winds) (RFF < 50 bad, RFF 50-55 suspect, RFF 56-84 neutral, RFF > 84 good). Prior to this, all MODIS winds received a neutral quality mark.
     02/21/2007/1200UTC:
           MODIS IR (long-wave) and WV (cloud-top and deep-layer) winds are now dumped into "satwnd" files in the NAM and NDAS networks (as previously done in the GFS and GDAS networks) (not yet included in the NAM or NDAS PREPBUFR files and not yet assimilated in the NAM or NDAS networks).
     12/04/2007/1200UTC:
           MODIS IR (long-wave) and WV (cloud-top and deep layer) winds are now written into PREPBUFR files in NAM and NDAS networks.   MODIS IR (long-wave) and WV (cloud-top) winds now monitored (but not yet used) by the NAM/NDAS GSI.  MODIS WV (deep-layer) winds are still not monitored (let alone used) by the NAM/NDAS GSI.
     03/31/2008/1200UTC:
           MODIS IR (long-wave) and WV (cloud-top and deep-layer) winds now assimilated by NAM/NDAS GSI.
     09/15/2008/1500UTC:
           MODIS IR (long-wave) and WV (cloud-top and deep-layer) winds are now included in the "satwnd" dump file and the PREPBUFR file in the RUC network (report type 257/258/259).  These data are not assimilated by the RUC analysis.  They will be used by the future (2009) RapidRefresh system.
     11/12/2008/1200UTC:
           MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) now ingested into operational /dcom database (into tank b008/xx041).  These are not yet dumped in any network. 
     09/28/2010/1200UTC:
           MODIS winds now dumped in the RTMA network (as part of "satwnd") and are now encoded into the PREPBUFR file and are assimilated by the Guam RTMA run.
     07/18/2013:
           MODIS WV winds from Terra have degraded in quality due to problems with the MODIS WV channels.  As such, the SDM has updated the SDMEDIT file to purge the winds from all Terra WV reports dumped from tank b005/xx071.  This will keep them out of the GSI.
     07/25/2013/1500UTC:
           MODIS WV winds from Terra has been suspended. Increased striping has been observed on NASA's MODIS Terra water vapor channels impacting the production of the polar wind vectors.  These will likely never return.
     01/24/2018/1400UTC:
          All files on NESDIS' DDS server migrated to their PDA server.




XIV. GPS-RO (RADIO OCCULTATION) DATA  

     06/26/2006/1200UTC:
           GPS-RO refractivity and bending-angle from CHAMP satellite series (received from NCAR) ingested into operational /dcom database (into tank b003/xx010).  No GPS-RO data are yet dumped or assimilated.
     02/20/2007/1200UTC:
           GPS-RO refractivity and bending-angle from COSMIC satellite series ingested into operational /dcom database (into tank b003/xx010 along with existing NCAR CHAMP satellite series GPS-RO data).  No GPS-RO data are yet dumped or assimilated. Over a period of time, currnetly not known, COSMIC-3, COSMIC-4, and later, COSMIC-2 and COSMIC-5 satellites stopped producing data.
     02/21/2007/1200UTC:
           GPS-RO refractivity and bending-angle from CHAMP satellite series (received from NCAR) and from COSMIC satellite series now dumped ("gpsro") in GFS and GDAS networks (not yet assimilated).
     05/01/2007/1200UTC:
           GPS-RO refractivity from COSMIC satellite series now assimilated in GFS and GDAS networks (Global-GSI became operational today). GPS-RO bending angle is not yet assimilated.  The CHAMP data (received from NCAR) arrive very late and little if any are available at the GFS and GDAS cutoff times - these are not assimilated anyway.
     Summer-Fall 2008:
           At some point during this time the CHAMP RO instrument "died".
     03/03/2009:
          GPS-RO data are now decoded by NCO via a feed from GTS rather than from the NESDIS DDS server.  This results a more robust system, less data latency and the addition of refractivity and bending-angle data from the METOP-2 (GRAS instrument) and GRACE-A satellites.  Only COSMIC refractivity data continue to be assimilated by the GFS/GDAS GSI.
     12/01/2009/1200UTC:
          GPS-RO refractivity and bending-angle from COSMIC, METOP-2/GRAS and GRACE-A are now dumped ("gpsro") in the NAM and NDAS networks.  These data are not yet assimilated or even monitored by the NAM/NDAS GSI.

           Reprocessed q.c.'d (but NOT superobed) METOP-2 ASCAT data from "ascatw" dump are now encoded into GFS and GDAS network PREPBUFR files under report type 290.  These are now monitored (but not yet used) by the GFS/GDAS GSI.
     09/14/2010/1600UTC:
           Upstream of NCEP, the ASCAT Winds Data Processor (AWDP) was upgraded to a new version 1.1. The output now contains up to four wind solutions rather than two. Since this time, no METOP-2 ASCAT data has been re-processed into the "ascatw" dumps that are read in by the PREPBUFR processing.  As a result, no METOP-2 ASCAT data has been encoded into the applicable PREPBUFR files since this time.  The METOP-2 ASCAT data are currently monitored by the operational GFS-GSI, used by the parallel GFS-GSI (in preparation for their use in the next GFS-GSI upgrade), used by the parallel NAM-GSI (in preparation for their use in the next NAM-GSI upgrade), used in some runs of the operational RTMA, and used by the parallel RapidRefresh.  An update to the program WAVE_DCODQUIKSCAT to correct this problem has been RFC'd.  Once this is implemented, the ASCAT winds will again be encoded into the re-processed "aswacw" dumps and thus into the PREPBUFR files.  (This was implemented 11/09/2010/1200UTC.)
     09/28/2010/1200UTC:
           METOP-2 ASCAT data now dumped in the RTMA network ("ascatt") and q.c.'d (but NOT superobed) ("ascatw") by reprocessing program WAVE_DCODQUIKSCAT.  These reprocessed data are now encoded into the PREPBUFR file and are assimilated by the 2.5 km CONUS and Guam RTMA runs.
     05/03/2011/1200UTC:
           METOP-2 ASCAT data now dumped in the NAM and NDAS networks ("ascatt") and q.c.'d (but NOT superobed) ("ascatw") by reprocessing program WAVE_DCODQUIKSCAT. These reprocessed data are now encoded into the NAM and NDAS PREPBUFR files but they are not yet assimilated or even monitored by the NAM/NDAS GSI.
     05/09/2011/1200UTC:
           Non-superobed METOP-2 ASCAT data are now assimilated by the GFS/GDAS GSI (they had been monitored).
     10/18/2011/1200UTC:
           Non-superobed METOP-2 ASCAT data are now assimilated by the NAM/NDAS GSI (they had not even been monitored except in parallel).

          The RAP (which replaces the RUC today) assimlates the GOES-11 and GOES-13 1x1 field-of-view cloud data from LaRC.
     09/23-24/2012:
           The GOES-13 (East) sounder instrument (and imager instrument) has degraded in quality due to an anomaly and went out of service on 09/23/2012/1126UTC. On 09/24/2012/0030UTC, NESDIS began sending GOES-15 (West) data into the East files.  We were then getting duplicate cloud data but these were successfully removed in the dumpjb duplicate-checking process.  On 09/24/2012/1745UTC, NESDIS began sending GOES-14 data into the East files.  The RAP had used GOES-13 cloud data from LaRC.  It will now use GOES-14 cloud data from LaRC. GOES-14 is currently positioned at 105W but will soon begin to drift eastward towards the location of GOES-13 at 75W.
     10/18/2012/1444UTC:
           NESDIS is switching GOES-E satellite back to GOES-13 (from temporary GOES-14, see above).  The RAP will, as before, use GOES-13 cloud data from LaRC (just as it did for GOES-14).
     05/22/2013/0340UTC:
           The GOES-13 (East) satellite has been affected by an anomaly which has shut down the sounder (and imager) instruments. The last RAP cycle to receive GOES-13 data was 03z 5/22.  On 05/23/2013/0600UTC, NESDIS began the process of sending GOES-14 data into the East files.  The RAP had used GOES-13 cloud data from LaRC.  It will now use GOES-14 cloud data from LaRC (effective 17z 5/23 - the ingest was switched to process GOES-14 instead of GOES-13 at 13z 5/23 and LaRC started processing GOES-14 at 16z 5/23).  GOES-14 is currently positioned at 105W.  There are no plans now to move GOES-14 from its current position.
     10/29/2013/1200UTC:
           LaRC GOES cloud data from now ingested from both the primary LaRC server Integrity) and the backup LaRC server (Typhoon), rather than from just Integrity, if any of its files are less than six hours old.  Otherwise, files are ingested from just Typhoon.
     04/08/2014/1200UTC:
           GOES-11 and GOES-13 1x1 field-of-view cloud data dumped ("lgycld") in NAM and NDAS networks.  Not yet assimilated.

           GOES-11 and GOES-13 1x1 field-of-view cloud data (read from "lgycld" dump) now assimilated by NAM/NDAS GSI.
     05/2014:
           LaRC Integrity machine went down.  Files are only ingested from Typhoon.
     11/19/2016:
           GOES-R launched.  It became GOES-16 when it reached final orbit on 11/29/2016.
     12/18/2017/2100UTC:
           GOES-16 replaced GOES-13 at the GOES-East satellite.  It is stationed at 75.2 degrees West.  NCEP continues to use GOES-13 products.
     12/21/2017/1200UTC:
           The ESRL server gsdftp now serves as the backup server for these files.  The primary server remains LaRC's Typhoon.  Both servers are queried for new files, however as long as Typhoon is up and running duplicate files are not pulled from gsdftp.
     12/28/2017/1815UTC
           GOES-16 replaced GOES-13 as GOES-E and is now providing the 1x1 field-of-view cloud data assimilated by the RAP and NAM/NDAS GSI.
     01/06/2018/1730UTC:
           The number of GOES-16 1x1 field-of-viewcloud data processed doubled as data are now provided every 15-min (files at xx:00, xx:15, xx:30 and xx:45) instead of every 30-min (files at xx:15 and xx:45 each hour).  There is no change to the number of GOES-15 data as it is still provided every 30 min (files at xx:00 and xx:30).
     03/01/2018:
           GOES-S launched.  It became GOES-17 when it reached final orbit on 03/12/2018.
